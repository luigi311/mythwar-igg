  <br>
  there should be special quests and events for each class. like when your warrior becomes a paliden there should be an undead killer quest that will allow you to get special items that only a paliden can get... I know this might sound stupid but it will make people want to try all the different classes.

  &quot;Mall Point Promotion&quot;<br>

  <br>
  heres some&nbsp;&nbsp;Advice for the Mythwar Open Beta<br>
  how bout all the gm's tecks anyone that can write code igg's side get to gether and fix some of the npc's then hold a vote from the players of which npc's work the best, players that vote for the best working npc's get reworded with mw2 mall points, where they can then buy items from mall being as beta data will get wiped anyway then you could also get feed back on mall items and there functionality<br>
  <br>
  in short, i think its more of a closed alpha testing becose igg has little to show for there work and or effords make feed back and testing a game and rewords that will get wiped at the end of testing is reather kind of lame so it should all be geared twords improving your alpha server

  </div>It is called Vent, people who want to do that can already do so. Not to attack you or anything, I just don't want to suddenly hear a group of 12-16 year olds arguing over stupid stuff every time that I turn on the headphone feature.

  <b>Author:</b> Renana9&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Time:</b> 2008-6-16 11:34 PM &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Subject:</b> My first feedback on Test<br>
  <br>
  Here is my feedback.&nbsp;&nbsp;Started playing at 7:00 p.m.<br>
  <br>
  Quest #1:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  The birth of Freshmen(Lv:1)<br>
  change to:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  The Birth of Freshmen (Lv: 1)<br>
  (where underlined is where I suggest new text or spaces)<br>
  <br>
  I could not find a pvp called &quot;Freshman leader&quot; as described in the text.&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructions go on to describe:&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to Woodlinger Newbie Area(259,57), find newbie Guide and accept the Reward:&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Add spaces before and after each word.&nbsp;&nbsp;Capitalize Newbie.&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not find a &quot;Newbie Guide&quot; or anything called &quot;The Freshman leader.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;The only NPC that gave me any text when I clicked on them was the &quot;Help Newbie&quot; character and it was not right NPC.&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;Skill Mentor&quot; and &quot;Skill Guide&quot; did nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;After that the Help Newbie angel didn't work.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; It's now 8:10 p.m. and I am so frustrated, it is all I can do to gain enough control not to throw this PC off the desk.&nbsp;&nbsp;I need a break.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll try again tomorrow night.<br>
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
  QUESTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I proofread for a living, it almost killed me to see so many typos, spelling errors, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have someone else proofing the manual, would you tell us so we don't duplicate that effort?<br>
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
  The rest of these comments are from the Mythwar Manual:<br>
  Race Introduction&nbsp;&nbsp;Spelling errors:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  for Human:&nbsp; &nbsp; change:&nbsp;&nbsp;In huamn's&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; to:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In human's...&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  between is spelled wrong<br>
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
  for Centaur:<br>
  It says:&nbsp;&nbsp;The attribute that grows fastest of Centaurs' is agility ...<br>
  change to:&nbsp;&nbsp;The Centaur's attribute that grows fastest is agility ...<br>
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>

  <br>
  A sentinel friend told me that the benefit of being a VIP in MW2 is that you can personally talk to a GM...I have a better idea: at least give the VIP's better pets at the beginning of the game(e.g. a dark giant or a tauren)...I mean we are VIP's after all and we came from MW1 to play MW2....We would like a little bit of appreciation for that...

  1.The Growth Rate system for pet was better in MW 1 so i suggest to get it to MW 2<br>
  2. The exp bar with I-X from MW 1 to MW 2<br>
  3. New guild rank like Vice guild master that can join ppl to guild but can't kick them.<br>
  He can only promote and demote this way soldier-warrior warrior-soldier.<br>
  4. No sure what it the spiecies is i heard when it go 0 pet die ): i suggest to delete this or put the item to greatly incrase it in grocery not in item mall!<br>
  5.Repair tons of bug and translation <img src="images/smilies/default/tongue.gif" smilieid="7" border="0" alt=""><br>
  6.Maybe new background song?? Mostly player have off music because is too annoying<br>
  7.More quests like getting evil blood or hades star or wierd pearl will greatly improve game.<br>
  8. Only 3h of 2x per week ?? i suggest go to 8-14<br>
  9. More pet to hold, it was good in mw I<br>
  10. More friendship rank<br>
  11. More colour skill rank like<br>
  12.Improved Guild War like all party spot randomaly in gw not in the same place<br>
  13.No item,benefit and other reward for ppl from MW I even no for V.I.P to ge all chance fresh start don't follow the rule &quot;Who got $$ he rule game&quot;<br>
  14. At last 1 server with time GMT +8<br>
  15. Paying for talk in world is bad idea , lvl 10 will be good to able speak in world chat<br>
  16. More Emoticons <img src="images/smilies/default/smile.gif" smilieid="1" border="0" alt=""><br>
  17. Improve Crafting Sytem: Add more item that u need for crafting like wood for bow or iron for sword<br>
  18.More weekly event <img src="images/smilies/default/smile.gif" smilieid="1" border="0" alt=""><br>

  <br>
  The first even should be where you have to talk to a rare pet breeder, which will spawn in woodlingor(you guys choose) he will ask to catch a certain pet(you have to set certain pet in battle mode) and if you catch the right pet you get super potions(Medium chance)/rare pet(Low chance)/Mystical fruits(High chance)<br>
  <br>

  <br>
  &quot;Feeding Frenzy&quot;<br>
  When the &quot;pet&quot; monsters appear more often. Like at a 35% ratio. So that people that have a favorite can have a race for it. I think it should be open about once a month for about 30 mins. (Just to make it not tooo easy.)and Hurricanes apear about every 10 minutes, along with Spirit Beasts.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Hide and Seek&quot;<br>
  Have a GM or a special somone be a person that is hidden. Then announce it and &quot;seekers&quot; have to find the &quot;hider&quot; and announce the cordinates out loud on world chat. You shuold warp that random &quot;hder: though, if its not a GM to a random location. Announcment might look like: &quot;Player (name) has been randomly choosen! They have been hidden somewhere, go and find them now!&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;A moment of Silence&quot;<br>
  Have an NPC like the Crabs Pit NPC that warps players to a designated area when event arises and&nbsp;&nbsp;announce something like, &quot;Silence is golden, and you will be too if your quiet!&quot; so that players know that it has started. For a certain duration of time if nobody talks they might recieve 200k or something. BUT players that do speak, emote, etc. will be warped to a certain location outside of the designated area as to not confuse.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Capture the Flag&quot;<br>
  Have a certain NPC that warps players to a large map and have another NPC there that will assign them to a team. Then the two teams play capture the flag. Might be held on weekends and such, when people just want to give a break on lvlng and do something fun. Make the limit score something high like, 150 or 200, just so it lasts.

  <br>
  I have a couple of suggestions for events, similar to others posted here and some not. Some are events I ran or tried to run as a Guild leader.<br>
  1: Pet war. Already run as an event and already posted here. But my suggestion to alter this slightly would be to give at least 2 weeks notice on which class of pet or type of pet. Use low class and common pets for the battles as well. This will give people wishing to participate a chance to aquire one and level it up to participate.<br>
  <br>
  2: Hide and Seek. Again, already used and suggested. However, my suggestion here, and also what I did for a guild event is this. Make multiple npc's to find which must be found in order. On finding them the npc will ask a question. This can be a MW related question or some obscure fact which must be researched. On giving the correct answer, the npc gives the player an item. This item then identifies the player to the next npc which must be sought out and again a question answered. When all npc's have been found and the last question answered and the last item obtained the player returns the item to a designated GM/ npc. The 1st player back receives the reward. When I ran as a Guild event, I made 6 alts to hide and made players ask questions and receive answers via pm. I also had 1st,2nd and 3rd place winners. It seemed a popular event and lasted a few hours. Cost me a fortune in the mall for prizes, but was worth it.<br>
  <br>
  3: Capture and rescue. The GM's make a party of 4 players and go into world at random and capture a player into thier team. Once captured the clock starts for 1 hour. The captured player must then be rescued by his fellow guild mates or friends. To rescue the player a party must battle the GM team and defeat it. Ok, a little twist. The captured player as part of the team can choose two option. 1 to do nothing and try help his rescuers, or fight on the side of the gm's. If a party beats the GM party then the player is deemed rescued and the opposing team receive a small reward. If however the captured player helps defeat his rescuers, then the GM's after the set period, may reward him alone instead. The battle must start before the clock runs out and then if no challenges have come the player is returned with no rewards and a new player is captured at random.<br>
  I like the aspect on this where the captured player has to choose whether to fight his/her friends or or fight on the side of the GM's.<br>
  <br>
  4. Just added this after reading another post which gave me the idea. Costume event/rewards. How about adding some rewards to events or even quests that give you a costume change/upgrade. This would allow some player individualisation to thier respective characters.<br>
  <br>
  Any way, just a couple of suggestions. Hope you get the idea.<br>

  to talk in marketchat u need to type a certain word.. in stead of &quot;sell&quot; &quot;buy&quot; &quot;need&quot; &quot;purchase&quot; &quot;vend&quot; &quot;transfer&quot; &quot;seek&quot; we should be able to use simple statement words like:<br>
  <br>
  <font color="red">WTS</font> ( Want To Sell )<br>
  <font color="red">WTB</font> ( Want To Buy )<br>
  <font color="red">WTT</font> ( Want To Trade )<br>

  the short names are used in many BIG games and it makes it 10 times easier as it is now!<br>

  the dirty words in this new version are hidden as ****<br>
  I think SOME of them shouldnt be hidden, like SB and GM<br>
  <br>
  GM is hidden because players sometimes want to curce the GM's..<br>
  but if all curcing words are hidden already, then why hide GM also?<br>
  When helping a newbie ingame, and you want to say: <font color="red">go to live support<br>
  and ask a GM about it</font>, you will get: <font color="red">go to live support<br>
  and ask a ** about it</font>..<br>
  <br>
  Its a simple suggestion, and I think you see what I mean, GM doesnt need to be hidden..<br>
  <br>
  as for <font color="red">SB</font>, what does <font color="red">SB</font> mean anyway? I know <font color="blue">BS</font> means <font color="blue">Bull***t</font>, but SB only means Saint Beast as far as I know lol.<br>
  when writing: <font color="green">My guild has just been disbanded</font> it will be: <font color="green">My guild has just been di**anded</font>.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  In the end maybe the best suggestion is to ONLY hide words with 3 letters or longer.<br>
  if not?<br>
  then also hide FK (***k), Fu (***k u), MF (mother ***ker), and more..

  To be able to talk in world you need to be at least lvl 6 (lvl 6 or higher), this is to prevent spamming in world with ALT chars. When you finally can talk in world after reaching lvl 6, you need to pay 500 gold per msg to say something. Newbies cant affort this. I think it should be half of it (250 gold), or maybe till lvl 20 250 gold and from 20 up 500 gold. Newbies have many questions and many new things to buy like armors etc. They spend more money on items to ONLY see what it is and what it does.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  You're preventing that worldchat gets spammed, but your punishing the honest newbies among us who just wanne ask some questions about the gameplay..<br>
  my question to u is: <font color="orange">What is more important?</font> since &quot;preventing&quot; is already there because of the &quot;lvl 6 rule&quot;.

  Catching pets in maps..............senario:<br>
  <br>
  - 2 times poison III (lvl 75) on a monster (= 2 times 12,5k = 25k damage)<br>
  - CPU the the pet -&gt; YES I got a nice pet<br>
  - *looks pet inven* -&gt; pet only got 5000 hp :s<br>
  <br>
  so the pet you catched is not the pet you were fighting with, its just a cope of it without the stats you expected. Although I dont know if this is a bug or just bad gameplay. You catch a pet with AT LEAST 25000 hp, and you get a pet with only 5000 hp :s not nice. You wonder; <font color="DarkOrange">is it even worth trying to catch a CHEIF pet when a normal pet might have better stats?</font><br>
  <br>
  My suggestion: give the players the pet they are seeing, not just a cope of its looks with lesser stats!

  In many games BOSS monsters are diffirent from the normal pet. They are either made with multiple heads, maybe bigger or perhaps a diffirent color.<br>
  In this case Im not talking about the BOSS monsters, but about the CHEIF monsters which are also a lot stronger as the normal ones.<br>
  <br>
  my suggestion;<br>
  <br>
  - give cheif monsters a orange name (only catchable by reborn players). After catching it, it should be stronger ofcource.<br>
  <br>
  - almost every pet in Myth War has a &quot;brother/sister&quot; (example: the blue Masker pet and the red/yellow Masker pet). Make the cheif pets/monsters diffirent! normal Maskers ingame are blue, and the cheif maskers are red/yellow. This gives more viriatie ( if spelled correctly :p ).. for me it would be another GREAT diffirence in the game!

  Hunters of pets:<br>
  <br>
  I suggest a competition for the players to know better the pets and their new grouwths,<br>
  To request in the system that would be a particular pet to be delivered to an npc, for example:<br>
  <br>
  The system sends a message, find and capture the Earth Wolf specie 10.673, or then find and capture a pet with |||||||||| STR, and specie 11.479.<br>
  <br>
  Thus, to encourage people to participate, should be placed a list with 5 players that captured most pets proposed in the day, being updated and displayed for all the channel system every 10 minutes.<br>
  <br>
  Finally the first 3 could be rewarded with some silver ingots or something else.<br>

  When the new look Mythwar, are still many texts written so wrong, whether by agreement, either by typing error at the time of development.<br>

  After thinking of a way to help correct such errors, I came the idea of a competition. During 5 days people would be called to read all the texts that exist in the game and assess, noting that the error, he was found, and because it is wrong. The reports of errors should be sent in a single email, considering only the first email sent. People who find more errors would be rewarded to encourage people to seek such errors.<br>

    </blockquote>
  </div>As I understand it and having tried catching lots of the same pets from the same area, the level of pet is within a specific range for that area. So, EG; You can catch a Tauren in Tum 1 that will always be a lower level than Tum 4.<br>
  Also the gr for the pets are totally random with the the min and max range. As is the build of the pet. Agian EG; you can catch two, lets say bubble Archers from Tum 3 one after the other. Lets say both are same gr and level. However, one might have a predominant sta build, whereas the other might be a predominant str build. I actually like this in a way, although it will stress the pro players who only want perfect pets all the time. You still have the option through items to change the gr,build,res of pets, but I think in MW2 there will be less perfect pets about. This I think adds an interesting feature for pvp battles where not necessarily the fastest pet wins.

  Consider what item you are putting to item mall:<br>
  Devil tear is very usefull item and it should be in grocery<br>
  Stone of Dream and Stone of Curse should be in grocery too<br>
  Item called Phoenix Stone and Super Phoenix Stone add the species point...this is not fair that ppl who can't afford that can't use pet later ): i suggest put at last phoenix stone in grocery<br>
  Also a rose or magical crystall are very usefull item that shoulb be sell at NPC not item mall..<br>
  In the game called Perfect World there is a item mall who sell only the mounts,the item change look or the inventory extension&nbsp;&nbsp;there is not a Super high gems,armors etc.. and it will greatly incrase the fun of the game if u think a little about it

  Since these will be the very first players of MW2 that I hope will stay and not get erased, why not hold event like the one last mw1 anniv? The wish event that gave away oceanic stones to help with skills and mf for pet levels. Then the box hunt that gave chocolates. These events are designed to help the first players level up quickly. Of course in MW2 there may be some differences since I havent seen chocolates and oceanics in mall. Maybe they could be different items that does the same things? <img src="images/smilies/new/f17.gif" smilieid="92" border="0" alt="">

  The amount of gold to speak in world is a little too much, ya?<br>
  <br>
  But I think that the biggest problem is the items that are bieng forced in mall. Can we put the basic stuff back in NPC stores? Such as Magic Crystals, Devil Tear? It would also be good if we had Stone of Dream, and Stone of Curses in NPC stores too, bieng that the pets that we catch dont have good builds at all usually.<br>
  <br>
  Three hours of double exp per week? Thats a litle low. As they said before, maybe raise it to 8-14?<br>
  <br>
  Maybe only censor &quot;bad&quot; words in World, Market, ect.. And have an option to turn &quot;bad&quot; words on and off in local channel? Hehe.<br>

  Why not hold an event like race to catch a pet...A gm will announce in world chat what pet he needs and players must catch them from the wild...stats would show those pets are from wild so gm can verify...first one to get to gm in a secret hiding place and give the specified pet wins...pretty simple but i leave it to&nbsp;&nbsp;gm's to set rules and prizes <img src="images/smilies/new/f17.gif" smilieid="92" border="0" alt="">

  I started playing in the new year whilst christmassevent was on. The event was only 4 high rank players and I could not compete.<br>
  The chineese new year even needed teams of hign rankink players. Please what ever you do make the events fun for all not just for some of the players. e.g. let solo low players also have a chance (does not need 2 go to demon lair 4 to find a box as he will not make it

  <br>
  First thing first most games that have second installement will allow player transfer thier account over.From what take they have no intention of doing this.recreaction of pets and enemies little bit far too go.Most of the new event and new stuff could easily been put into mw1.the game is gonna mainly mall needy and lack of gold will make most new comers unable to do anything.But what friends and I gahter from playing beta is that take good add on like player locking system,mail system,auto abilities,and 2nd reborn add it to mythwars one and there is no need in mw2.aps are extremely small and all enemies cast way too much.So the in all the basical took mw1 rearranges all maps and got most npc battle in wrong maps,they didnt take time survey people see what they thought need added.They just made same game but bad version off it.Thanks allowing us try it out.But dont think anyone will leave mw1 to play mw2.

      As I understand it and having tried catching lots of the same pets from the same area, the level of pet is within a specific range for that area. So, EG; You can catch a Tauren in Tum 1 that will always be a lower level than Tum 4.<br>
      Also the gr for the pets are totally random with the the min and max range. As is the build of the pet. Agian EG; you can catch two, lets say bubble Archers from Tum 3 one after the other. Lets say both are same gr and level. However, one might have a predominant sta build, whereas the other might be a predominant str build. I actually like this in a way, although it will stress the pro players who only want perfect pets all the time. You still have the option through items to change the gr,build,res of pets, but I think in MW2 there will be less perfect pets about. This I think adds an interesting feature for pvp battles where not necessarily the fastest pet wins.

  </div>ur telling ur version of what u have seen, but doesnt add anything to my post..<br>
  I like getting diffirent builds etc YES, but what I dont like is not getting what I expect!<br>
  EG;<br>
  ur in a store and u see a computer, on the box of the computer it says it runs on the best and most currect thing in the world (u get what I mean, u read it is the best computer in the world at that time).. when u got home - installed the pc - turns out to be the oldest pc in the world with the big floppy discs..<br>
  <br>
  compair that situation to the game play;<br>
  ur in a battle and u see a monster, you cast poison III on it seviral times (13k damage each time) - you catch it - look at ur new pet - turns out to have 3000 hp only..<br>
  <br>
  U DONT GET WHAT U SEE, and thats for me a big dissapointment and they should change it!

  Things I saw in a week of mw2<br>
  <br>
  Even with level's the names on teles dont change to green as if to say (your good to go)<br>
  <br>
  Certain things only worked on certain servers (to lose ssp with that ruby thing, only worked on server 3)<br>
  <br>
  Gold is a major problem, even worse game promotes self using of mall verse buying from someone else who uses mall.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mall users actually going to have to do some work (although can get gold from there <img src="images/smilies/new/f95.gif" smilieid="55" border="0" alt="">)<br>
  <br>
  This only being able to use pets after having a specific title is a waste <img src="images/smilies/new/f10.gif" smilieid="42" border="0" alt="">.&nbsp;&nbsp;can catch a felsworn at lvl 25 cant use it til you have done first soulstone quest.&nbsp;&nbsp;Exp after level 101 is relatively difficult so <strong>MOST</strong> people save the soulstones for that since they do give decent exp <img src="images/smilies/new/f10.gif" smilieid="42" border="0" alt="">.<br>
  <br>
  Anyone who wants to take the time to do mokka before level 50 can acrue more than enough talent points to max out 3/4 skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;The limit on mokka for skill was nice, but now its just a level limit which blows <img src="images/smilies/new/f77.gif" smilieid="73" border="0" alt=""><br>
  <br>
  There are concepts in the game that are indeed great, the general idea behind the game could use alot more work.&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides that Im kinda curious how &quot;a totally different game&quot; still has the same bugs for the same quests <img src="images/smilies/new/f85.gif" smilieid="80" border="0" alt="">

  The pets have too high requirements...e.g. ALL the pets in the item mall have requirements...They're from the Item Mall!They shouldn't have any requirements.<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; To compensate the lowering of the title requirements,simply make the&nbsp;&nbsp;catchable pets harder to catch and the item mall pets more expensive...I'd say that would be a HUUUGE improve.

  </div>hmm, so you think 50 USD for a pet from mall should be even more expencive?<br>
  and for ppl who dont buy itemmall points, is it fair just because of ur idea they should hunt pets for hours? but hey if those pets were good enough (like in one of my suggestions) then yes, I would hunt longer if needed, but not for a max 5000 hp pet

  <br>
  i was thinking that there could be certain quest areas for different levels say from lvl 10-15, 20-25 etc. Randomally, a special item for that area will drop (untradable) which gives a heap of exp to the user, to help them gain levels beacuse in the past it was quite hard to level.. And then once you're level 60, well keep the seal like ideas in MW 1 where you have to find a party to determine who are the hardcore players are <img src="images/smilies/default/smile.gif" smilieid="1" border="0" alt=""> Omg and you can catch every single pet, like pokemon, that would be AWESOME (sorry if that is implanted i have not played the game &gt;__&gt;) <img src="images/smilies/default/smile.gif" smilieid="1" border="0" alt="">

  As we all know a <font color="Sienna">timezone</font> in a game can be very irritating!<br>
  not only because of your personel life, but also because activities can be held on<br>
  times you're in bed sleeping.<br>
  <br>
  I understand IGG want to keep GTM -5 because they aim on the USA players.<br>
  <br>
  Though IGG needs to understand that there are many many players from all over the world<br>
  playing their game. Maybe even more then from the USA itself.<br>
  <br>
  After saying this I STILL understand that IGG wants to aim at the USA players.<br>
  <br>
  I believe IGG have had many discussions about this problem hence they made 4 servers with<br>
  4 diffirent timezones in MW 1.<br>
  I think there were to few players for 4 servers, thats why the merge, but I cant say anything about that since its not confirmed!<br>
  <br>
  In MW 1 the server merge went well I think, besides the name loss etc from the disapearing server players.<br>
  European players can easely adept to GTM +8 in weekends and also often on the other days, and I believe the Cali players can easely adept to GTM -5.<br>
  <br>
  My suggestion would be, make 2 main servers, 1 GTM -5 and 1 GTM +8 with each 3 or 4 sub-servers (like test 1, test 2, test 3 in closed beta) This way ppl from other time zones dont have to start over again in like an half year when IGG finally decides to make another server.

  GMT +8 works well for some things, but from GMT 0, all the events in the last year or so fell into a zone which was always &quot;during the day&quot;, when working people are at work.

  Integral system must change in order to NOT have as much winners as we did have.. a rare pet isnt rare when 10 people win it every month.. thats 120 rare pets in a year.. Should include AoD +1 (not +3!!!) 1.3 gr pets, perhaps Xmas and boss pets.. keep the % of winning something LOW! last price could also be something like Silver Ignots (thats at least better then new integrales)<br>
