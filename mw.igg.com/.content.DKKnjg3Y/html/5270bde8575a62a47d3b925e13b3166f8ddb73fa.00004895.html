  There should be trainer device pack or MF pack ... Or Better pet eggs, like at devil egg you have only a lil chance to get Devil.Would be good eggs that you get 1 pet, not random pet.<img src="images/smilies/new/f61.gif" smilieid="41" border="0" alt="">

  To be able to buy any pet you want instead of hoping with random chance from eggs, this would hopefully reduce the ingame costs of some pets

  i agree with bratz pack to some extent, u need to make a bigger mf then the 1.5mil in a bundle pack of 10 better eeg deals and or packs. Lower prices on some of the items like chocolates and how about a chocolate bundle pack of some kind. Come on guys its hard enough to lvl already need to get a little more help when no else will help.

  why ppl ask for item who do more and more easy the game <img src="images/smilies/new/f80.gif" smilieid="84" border="0" alt=""> ? And i mean all are &quot;lazy itmes&quot;. Plz if you add new items put sumting who give us new strategic possibilities, no same things in package or things like that...<br>
  <br>
  Why do more pets with nice gr? we have alot of them... if add new pets think on &quot;creative&quot; resist like zodiacs or sand giant, or strategic pets like dream dragon.<br>
  Nice items can be the ores for higher equips, or a item who reset stats/ resist but not lvl and gr for pets (so we can fix our reborn pet without lost gr), maybe a item with chance to lvl up bangles and neks, same for regeants... but why AODs on item mall or deitys?... what gonna happend with the game when everyone use JUST dark dreams? for what the other pets?, why put necks+3, high ores, if we gonna can buy AOD's directly?<br>
  <br>
  Im item mall buyer (vip barely XD) and lazy too, when i finally have all the things i want i gonna leave the game for sure, bc dont gonna be funny anymore<br>

  I'd say a mystic fruit package and exp scroll would be amazing. Have say a rare 2mil mf (item mall only), one 1.5mil, and a few 600k's. And for the human exp have say a scroll or something that gives you say 2mil exp. Also better package deals with better pets and better items. Maybe also a gold card bought from the mall.

  i know what i dont want to see in mall ... gold cards , trainer devices , chocolates<br>
  <br>
  this is basically the only game that i have seen so far that sell absolutly free (not x2,3,4 exp) and gold and worst of all macros for real cash ...<br>
  just look at it logically for a sec , if game breaks their own rules about not using bots aka macros ... how in the hell you expect players to respect that rule ?

  RINGS! My char has 10 fingers but theres only 1 ring slot... yet there are no rings in the game. (Male chars can probably use 11 rings.. 1 of the male chicken variety).<br>
  <br>
  Why not add a lottery stone (sell cheap of course like 1-2 mall points so ppl can use their spare/leftover points instead of wasting it). Let the lottery stone spawn anything at random from pets to banananananas<br>
  <br>
  1 very useful item... an anti-spectating item (hint:ring) or an anti-join item when the party is already full.... i cant stand the blinking lights especially when im at survivor or papa

  Why not have +13 gems that give resistance to Frailty, Drain, Crit, Physical, and Magic Reflect. This way it will balance out the game since all other races have resitance that can reduce the amount of attack.<br>
  <br>
  Also if create some high level reagents tht can be used on any gear such as crit resist, drain resist, or 10% hp or mp increase, etc.<br>
  <br>
  Last make High level bangles that can have gems, ess, and regents imbued on them.

  era99 You misunderstood my post. The Item Mall doesn't have +13 Frailty resist. As for Physical/magic reflect, it is not a resistance against it, but to increase your physical/magic relfect rate and damage so that you have that ability to reflect damage back at your attacker. That too isn't in the Item mall.

  <br>
  Lets Face it no matter how hard we try there is never enough room in our inventory for all the needed items, more so for the non reborn. You carry sets of gears. Fire, chaos, melee, int(spamming) not to mention all your fruits, and nonsense. In no time your bags are full and your bank is full. Always tossing things around, making mules and then searching all mules to find one thing. Why not save the hassle and make mini backpacks/bags? Small slot bags that can hold certian items, such as equips, gems, pots and so on. even a 4 slot bag till save a whole lot of room. So you can put in any item and take it out at any time and make it to where its not binding. you can sell them trade them(only if empty of course) It would be alot easier if we had more storage space, then always tossing items to make room for the new. and make them small enough price to finish off our mall points.<br>
  <br>
  Face it its kinda of a pain seeing 2-9 points left on your account that you will never be able to fully use. and in a sence its a waste of our money. If all else why not let it gain interest. If you have 4 mp and over a period of time it can grow. so we can soon spend all the points

  <b>Author:</b> MarkieWylde&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Time:</b> 2008-4-3 00:47 &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Subject:</b> A few ideas huh.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="blue">The items in a mall were a good idea. It Gives some the advantage over others. But why play a game. To work hard and dominate, To be the best player in the game in be reconized for it. But alot of the items in the mall are rather overpriced and some of the items hardly anyone ever guys. Fireworks, music boxes i mean common who is going to buy MP just to spamm a cheezy message for 5 min or emmit sparks in the game for half a second. Why not reduce some of the prices to burn left over points.</font><br>
  <br>
  <font color="RoyalBlue">As far as Eggs being random. Its kind of a rip off to us. Granted the idea was great but common random. ive bought 10 eggs looking to get 1 of 2 pets and yet i get 8 of the same cheap pet 1 ok pet and one that i could get in the game itself. why not reduce the pets within each egg. like maybe down to 2 or 3 and make it actual random. And not toss in lame pet liek a lizzard miner that is like a noobish pet and yet that would be the most common one you get. And it will irritate many that spend all that money hoping to get a certian pet and yet be let down and upset because they in a sense wasted all that money and didnt even come close to what they hoped. and most of the time the pets you end up with are not worth hardly anything in game. Make it actual random not a chance percentage within each egg to get that pet...make it all equal you could get a feral wolf one egg, leppard wold another, Masker in another for example...make it random...not percentage chance random</font><br>
  <br>
  Also everytime a new item comes out you price it so high for a long time then slowly reduce the price when no one buys as many as you had hoped. Pets are just pets although they are a rather good asset to each character, and certian types of pets are needed for certain instances. and you come out with new pets but yet the gr is just the same as other pets why not make a 1.350 maxx gr 1.325 more rare type of a gr for each pet. And make each pet more rare not 15 pets the same gr because in the end not alot is different in stats for each pet 1k hp 2k mp or what ever. Alot of times its like taking an old pet and throwing a new skin on it and giving it a different name and selling it online. Some people cant buy and spend Mall points on a daily/weekly even monthly baisis. So Why not come in game see what are common, uncommon, rare pets. And be able to sell eggs in mall according to what they are worth in game. Not just sell a new pet have it popular for a month that everyone wants one and then have it turn out that a weak lizzard miner for example is better than your new pet it just looks better.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  As i started to say in the beginning everyone wants to be the best in the game. but what happens when you are maxxed skills, maxxed levels. Nothing half the time you sit in one area and talk to people and stare at a screen. yippee. Why not make it a little more interesting. AoD is great and can be a life saver. but you go aginst a party with amazing pets and full Sets of AoD gear your toast. Why now make the armor breakable Aod or not. give it a duribility rating after so many hits/fights the armor breaks. you can still wear it but its like not having armor at all. Make it so where it can be repaired (with a blacksmith hammer from a NPC for example) so many times then its done. say 10 times. after the 10th repair it breaks. People do spend alot of money making sets and in a sence it would seem umfair. but in return it would make it cheaper and easier to make sets. Why give all the maxxed out high lv reborns all the advantage. they can just exits 6 times and make a new set while ut unskilled hardly can make hald a set without selling about everything they have. but that would also make it a more equal playing level.<br>
  <br>
  And pets. like I said a life saver and very handy. and granted we all work hard very hard to build some pets. you hatch it, help it grow. then when its maxxed its over. why not give a period life cycle? you hatch build it let it grow to an adult. but it never dies(officially). Why not let it reincarnate ( with a life stone From a NPC for example of a name) after so long or you could not use it in battle anymore. if its reborn and lv 120 say over 6 months so to speak dies then reincarnates maybe giving a .001 gr increase or decrease and goes back to lv 90 or something...make it to where over a time its reduced in life a certain percentage. Taken in mind not alot of people play on a common basis and it would be unfair to come back after a year and all your pets are lv 1 or 1-1. but make it online aged online time liek your reputation points. It idea may seem retarded. but think of how it would level the playing field, also have more people interact more. it will keep you playing, keep you working. And even if its traded it still has a life cycle. so you cant just trade it off to another of your characters and regain the cycle. you'd lose all your pets intimacy that way also if you traded.<br>
  <br>
  And another idea why not create a new item say we call it &quot;devils soul&quot; like Devils blood only have to enable battle on both ends. And only one person needs it. They fight and battle their hearts out. only instead of losing exp why not lose small amount of exp but Skill points say 50,100,200.. Make it to where when you fight you are actually fighting for your life and your glory. Make it to where there is no real best of the best in the game.<br>
  <br>
  And I dont want people to think im picking on the pros, that i am not one myslef. I have a few reborns high lvs and high skilled. so i am not picking on anyone in general. just tossing out new items and ideas. Once you acheive everything and become one of the best the game loses its fun. You work hard and want it just as bad. Then what happens after you get there nothing. You enjoy it for a few then you get bored of it. Bored of the game. Some quit for a while and take time off and some do not come back. At least some of these ideas would keep you playing, keep you enjoying the game.<br>
  <br>
  I hope that the ideas and comments were helpful, and feel free to comment or add to. No ones statment is ever bad, its just in a different point of view that you wanted to see.

  guess what markie they are called armor of dreams for a reason and supposed to give u a huge advantage in battle <img src="images/smilies/new/f45.gif" smilieid="79" border="0" alt="">. but they are truly effective when they are lvl 4 or 5 and to get those AOD's to that lvl u have to beat the odds of then breaking. so after going threw all that pain to lvling and actualy obtaining AOD's u want them to ahve a limited number of uses then they are not worth it at all.<br>
  and about resist sets and leveling the playing feild as u call it why shouldi after putting my time and energy for almost 2 years of playing have the same armors, pets etc... as someone who is only palying for a month or 2 or 6 ... i worked hard for my advantage in the game and damn well deserve it, this game is about getting better during time and hats why ppl are still playing it after all this time some on arch server for 3 plus years, thats why am against all this exp, chocklate,oceianic on mall they just take out all the fun from the game.<br>
  <br>
  and about pet durabilty and life cycle why do that... just lvl another pet.. u can lvl a lot of different tipes of pets (and they dont have to be expensive pets) and experement with differnt builds and such.. buld pets for specific quests/GW/PvP etc.....<br>

  i agree with other players.. why not make 1 pet per egg only?? that way is better than spending hundreds of dollars on mall points buying egg and then when u hatch it.. out pops a useless lizard miner!!! i mean why the hell u put a common pet on mall when other people can get it as low as 2 mil in-game gold or pet hunting?????<br>
  come on... people spend their money for pet egg so that they get some rare ones such as titans or others...<br>
  and its just not fair when some1 bought devil egg many times and they constantly got werewolf while some1 bought devil egg for the first time and voila... a CD!!!!<img src="images/smilies/new/f66.gif" smilieid="32" border="0" alt="">&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

  <br>
  How about you sell us a server? Then we can group together and save to buy one that doesn't lag since merger.<br>
  Also, maybe you could sell tele's to the parts of MW world that hasn't opened yet.<br>
  How about selling Guild NPC's that don't say &quot;Not Available yet&quot;?<br>
  Seriously though, I'd like to see some of the so called extinct items for sale. It seems unfair to new players that they are disadvantaged, however slight, by the older players having items that they will never be able to obtain. So like previous post said, maybe some +3's bangles etc.

  <br>
  Firstly, +13 Gems and Oceanic Stones should be removed from Mall... hold a larger number of events giving out such items, instead of making once &quot;rare&quot; items so easily available... as for implementation of new items, as others have said, Bangles, Rings, Small and Medium Dragon Ores would be nice. You could also make an item that can allow you to remove the resistance added to a particular Armor, that could help players who want to add better resistances to a rare item like adding +13x3 Speed Diamonds to +12 or +13 Shoes which had +12x3 Dodge added to them... another nice item would be one with which you could reset a pet's stats without affecting its growth, it could be a little more expensive than Stone of Moon. Sometimes, we make mistakes and stat reborn pets improperly, it would be good to be able to correct that mistake without having to sacrifice the pet's bonuses obtained from rebirth. A new type of Gem I have in mind is one which if used, gives random extra resist to Armor. It could be added as a 4th Gem to normal Armor, or the only one that can be added to an AoD.. it could be like a Gem of Dreams, upgrading can be done in a way similar to that of AoDs, the higher lvl the Gem, the more resistance it adds to the Armor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Would make it pretty interesting in PvP. Also, to counter the effects of this Gem, an extremely rare item could be introduced which has a low chance to negate the effects of the Gem on your opponent. For eg: if a GoD(Gem of Dreams) gives +50 Frailty res to your target, this item which I'm talking about could turn it into -50 Frail res instead. The chance of this happening should be low though, duels will be more fun and unpredictable. I know that this post should probably have been posted in the Suggestion Zone, but as all this is related to &quot;new Mall Items&quot;, it has been posted here.

  +13 items... would be nice to be able to forge them. I'm a forger myself but i can't train high forgeing because the ores are not on mall anymore... And that would be nice to be able to forge +13 shoes hehe<br>
  <br>
  For survival? No need. If prices of items were lower, then the gold we already have would be enough. But the market law is like that: more demand, more expensive. That is how we got to MF at 3 gold for 1 exp. We can't do anything about that exept stop buying them and hunting them ourselves lol.<br>
  <br>
  Items to reset the resistances of armors would be fairly good too.<br>
  <br>
  All the parts of game that are not implemented yet should be now. This game is old enough to have everything available by now. But i don't know what programmers are doing and don't want to criticize them without knowing. I just hope they still work on the matters in hold (mage country, npc in guild head quarters) and not only on new things (New pets essentially). I think the best thing to do is to implement all the things that were planned at the beginning, and when all that is finished, then can implement new things. But is only my opinion.

  First off i agree with many others. the eggs in mall..nice idea but retarded. why spend all that money on a cheap pet when people sell dieties for half the price youd pay for a pet half as good by the time youu get it. Limit the ammount of pets per agg. and when we buy eggs from mall spending out hard earned money atleast make all the pets maxx gr.<br>
  <br>
  Also like others said take out the bull crap no one ever buys. or at least redice eit enough that we can buy the crap items on mall for a real cheap price to burn left over points we cant get rid of. Make SoD availible ingame NPC's<br>
  <br>
  Ive been playing this game pretty much since it came out. Your events fell apart. id rather have a half bugged event then these cheezy guess a number or lucky number id. that is not an event seems more like a raffle. Bring our events back. and take some of the rare pets the DF, DD, capri, Aries, Aqua, give those in events. along with diety and AoD. When i started you all had events all the time. seemed at least once a month if not every 2 months. you held alot of players there. they liked the game we worked hard. And yet you have been promising us for 2+ years you were going ot finish the platform of the game, open the rest up, finish the NPC's but yet you worry more abotu creating new items for the mall so we cam pay your precious bills so you can come out with another game that will not be fuly finished. Common IGG finish what you start, dont do things half a$$ed and expect us to just deal with it. there are a whole lot better games. out there then this and even the new ones youhave made. only reason why some of us stay is the friends we have.<br>
  <br>
  Finish our maps, out npc's And actually interact with us. not sit in your desk chair and watch the dollars rack up ever time we buy mall items. what are you going ot do when everyone gets tired of half made games and gives up, they will quit buying mall items and youll servers and upgrades will be out of reach. Be loyal to your players and the ones like me that pay your bills. you basicly stabb us in the back every day. you started everything psyced us up about the game only to be lot down when the money rolled in and you all got greedy. finish what you start bring the oldschool game back, lots of fun, lots of events. and When GM's played along with us at times. We do alot of things for you and the best you can do is reduce us to cheezy events. and new mall items that turn out not to be all that great in the long run. COMMON IGG Get it to gether please...&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

  in 3+ years your game when from fun to crap. Face it IGG the mall is your savior now. You rip us off in a sense makeing us spend our hard earned money for what a crap pet. common. when the game came out it was all abotu the players. and we had alot of respect for you as you did us. but as the months pass yous staff changed. you no longer really care about the player only their money. Your events blow. you overcharge mall items. I understand servers cost a chunck of change a year to run and maintain. but wouldnt it be better if you cared about the people more than the money. we pay your bills. so-to-speak. complete the games. stop making empty promises. saying you'll open the rest of the maps, make the 2nd reborn system although pink for a second reborn<img src="images/smilies/new/f80.gif" smilieid="84" border="0" alt="">&nbsp;&nbsp;may be nice for the ladies. you lost alof of players over the years. in return for losing players you lost potential buyers.&nbsp;&nbsp;and almost all players have no respect for the GM and all IGG staff. you dont respect us. you dont interact with us. but your cheap play events. your game is only half made and has been since it came out but yout you release more games and more items and pets for the games. be loyal to your players as they will be loyal to you, finish the work you started and think more like us then like greedy people.<br>
  And alot of things on mall dont need to be on mall. make them availible in game. bring balance to the games economy again. give us our rings, and bangles, put things on mall in game, and hold better events, give HB's x-mas pets, aod, dieties zodiac. give us the events we used to have in the beginning of the game, spring event, fall event, halloween, x-mas, newyears, easter, valentines the way the used to be. and so on...back when the everage player had the chance to get a diety or great pet as the high ranked players do. I want the old mythwar back. your game went to chit.!!!!!!

  <br>
  I would also like to see medium and large copper and gold ores in the item mall. Trying to make those ores costs too much redeem points for so small results. I spent 10k redeem points trying to make big ores and only came away with 4. That's a high price to pay for just 4 big copper ores. Imagine how much I will have to pay to get the gold ores.<br>
  <br>
  I know a lot of people who have been playing the game since it started don't like the idea of adding good items such as +13 gems, medium and large ores, deity or saint pets, AoDs and such, but the fact is this game has become hugely a disadvantage for those who hasn't played the game that long. So I say put them in the item mall just to give others a chance to compete. Only certain people (special people) get the nice pets, AoDs and have now become so powerful no one can fight them. Yet, the game is supposed to be fair, but unfortunately not all the people are. Since the game is ruined already because of the costs of items and pets ingame that very few people can afford, why not allow them to get it through the item mall. Otherwise, increase the chances of getting such items in game. I like the idea of +13 gems in mall. That way I don't have to worry about paying 90+ mil for one +13 gem. People have become greedy in game and only those who have billions really have a chance of getting anything they want. Everyone else don't have a chance. So if people don't have enough game money to get these items why not allow them to use real money to get the same items. Then the balance of the game will be restored and anyone can become powerful.<br>
  <br>
  Some people actually worked hard to get what they have and would disagree with what I am saying and I understand that. But many have scammed, hacked or was lucky enough to be given such items from friends that already had them and that's how they got to where they are. But not everyone is that fortunate. So I say put those items on the Mall IGG. If you want money that's the way to do it. Give the people what they want since the game has already lost its integrity. Sell all AoDs, deitys, and saint pets in item mall for 3000-10000 mall points. You can also sell resistances to counter crit, and drain. That should really lower the in game price of items making them more affordable.<br>

  @ above post: People who have played over the years have worked hard to get their +13 Gems, AoDs, Deities and Saints. Introducing such items/pets in Mall only makes all the hard work old players put into the game go down the drain. Old players deserve what they have, new players just have to work hard to get that. This game isn't going anywhere(or is it? If it is then no use playing it, let alone getting good equipment<img src="images/smilies/new/f45.gif" smilieid="79" border="0" alt=""> ), and new players can always obtain rare things over time. Every one wants everything ready-made now, what's the use of events? And what about non-Mall buyers? All Mall buyers even if their not better players than normal players, would get a huge advantage just because they click a few links to buy a Deity, while others have to farm day and night during the not-so-often-held events which reward you with Deities/AoDs, even though they know there's a very very small chance of that happening. Normal Mall items aside, all players should have an equal chance of getting rare equipment, it should be hard work or luck which rewards them with that, not money. I hope Deities/AoDs are never introduced in the Item Mall, but events rewarding such items should be held a little more often.[Though I'm more than 90% sure that IGG WILL have Deities/AoDs in Mall because they just won't be able to resist the allure of a much fatter pocket[I wonder how fat their pockets can get<img src="images/smilies/new/f63.gif" smilieid="86" border="0" alt="">])

  It would be nice for lower prices on all of the items, it would be nice for certain items to return to their rightful places as being a challenge to get and there's such a thing as making it too easy - even if you have to pay to get to that stage.<br>

  2 - In short i think the game needs improvement more than it needs new mall pets and items.&nbsp;&nbsp;Restoring some balance to the already inflated game market could be helped by lowering prices of some of the existing eggs/items.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding new armor options as well would be nice +9 bangles, the introduction of rings.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the majority agree the game needs improvement and to see some new things more than it needs more things to give you money for.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a VIP and long time player here I can say I'm done spending my money on anything in the mall until I do see new game improvements.<br>
  <br>
  These 2 quotes could not be more true...<br>
  <br>
  1st- IGG point of view -<br>
  IGG gets what the game developers give them so they dont deserve all our crap, find a game developer and abuse him!&nbsp;&nbsp;IGG knows players are not happy and that they are losing money, do u think they would not want more stuff for the game to make it more indepth and more popular? Ofcourse they want new development and no doubt they are screaming at the game developers for that, so come on ppl ease up a bit, they are trying!<br>
  <br>
  2nd- Player point of view -<br>
  As a long time player I also must agree with this quote aswell, new items for the mall should not be IGGs main focus it should be new development!<br>
  <br>
  So lets all stop crying and team up with IGG then go beat up the game developers! <img src="images/smilies/new/f75.gif" smilieid="50" border="0" alt="">

  i say some thing about this topics in first pages but i was thinking may this aim to the aries pack.<br>
  Well a GOOD example about how don't do a pack is the &quot;capilla pack&quot;<br>
  <br>
  -----------------------------------------<br>
  capilla pack 599 mp<br>
  -----------------------------------------<br>
  you can have a chin with more gr and nice resit for 488mp... or sell items for LOT less mp and buy a capilla in game (around 50m/90m on acher server atm)<br>
  ----------------------------------------<br>
  <br>
  But you can even buy:<br>
  peculiar whammy egg (with luck give you a capilla or similar rated pet like mosq, dg or ghoul) =288 mp<br>
  avian flask = 50mp<br>
  unique flask = 60mp<br>
  5 millons gold you can win more with a sigle soc = 20mp<br>
  great gem sak (useless, more if you dont have service rate XD) = 30mp<br>
  3 g8 gems + 3 +24 ess = useless items<br>
  total mp = 448 <img src="images/smilies/new/f45.gif" smilieid="79" border="0" alt=""> so 151mp less than pack <img src="images/smilies/new/f17.gif" smilieid="92" border="0" alt=""><br>
  <br>
  (and btw the itme mall AL in the other pack dont have psn/chaos/stun/hyp resist <img src="images/smilies/new/f80.gif" smilieid="84" border="0" alt="">)<br>
  <br>
  is nice to c gm asking about what ppl whant (even on mall things) but could be nice too if this time they pay attention to what ppl is saying.

  Stop adding new things to mall, just make better events,implement new areas to game, implement second rb,remove +13 gemz from mall, give back sod's and som's to game, remove oceanics from mall...if u do all that u'll find people will spend lot more money in mall than for buying new things...

  i think that the ppl should win Mall points plying MW, maybe no to much mall points, but to many ppl cant buy&nbsp;&nbsp;mall point, i think that if u can win 1 or 2 mall points doing a quest to many ppl will be happy<br>
