  It says it will not effect the d/l or the codes, you will probably just not be able to log in when u install it.

I really don't understand what it is that you people are doing but this is the reason why people bitch and complain about your games.<br>

  what vampre dragon means to say is that he d/l and started up mw2 and when he trys to click next and create his person there is an error and he is not able to begin.<br>
  <br>
  Solution: Wait til thursday and try again<br>
  <br>
  SoluciÃ³n: Espere hasta jueves e intente otra vez<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Tragen: live support was kind of busy with replys from last night and today with the delay. What you have to realize is that Leo was probably talking to 2 other people. And saying &quot;HELLLOOOO!!!&quot; wasnt helping whatso ever. usually when i use live support i surf the web or do something else while waiting for live support talks t me first. and it usually works out.<br>

  </div>I disagree, she has a point. Although English is not my native language but I've no problem whatsoever with it. Ignorance is not an excuse. <img src="images/smilies/new/f78.gif" smilieid="72" border="0" alt=""><br>

  Now, back to subject. Any exact date/time defined yet for the start of the CBT? <img src="images/smilies/new/f16.gif" smilieid="90" border="0" alt="">

  Just to clear things up..I dont have a problem with her telling someone to speak &quot;english&quot; in an &quot;ENGLISH&quot; speaking forum. She could have reworded it though. The way she posted it made her seem rude.<img src="images/smilies/new/f82.gif" smilieid="51" border="0" alt=""><br>

  sigh....listen guys i already answered vampre's question..so stop talking about it and lets talk about the closed beta..i was wondering that during the closed beta what you guys think would be efficient. leveling up or retreating after every battle to explore all the different areas.

  might as well go for exploration seeing as the server will probably get wiped from what i heard.

  Can we all just stop arguing sheesh.<br>
  <br>
  You all are acting like babies.&nbsp;&nbsp;You realize ur asking alot from a company that offers FREE to play games. The best thing to do is just sit back relax and dont even worry.

  as much as it IS a Free to play company, i would still rather see them post a date for later on or NO date at all rather than this posting one, and then bumping it last minute when everyone is ready to play, even if it was an unforseen problem<br>

  </div>Yeh but they should have tested it to destruction in the Alpha phase first! To put it into a semi-open (keys on mmo websites not invite only) beta without the server, game etc being ready is just plain stupid!<br>
  <br>
  Also it now appears that they are pulling any topics and posts quiring this <img src="images/smilies/new/f24.gif" smilieid="75" border="0" alt=""><br>

  Hope so fast. Why IGG cant do more servers, like every country can do their own servers (or every country should make for itself with IGG together), and every server has an IP address and its public, so we just need to type in the IP address and get to the server we wanted to.

  You know guys. Since MythwarII is allready gaining a lot of attention.... rather it be negative or positive attention, just sit back and relax. Let the game come to you. In the mean time you can all just get on mythwar 1 and sell things/give away/ trade/ etc if your really going to mythwar II for 100%. I know that we should be getting much better service and more info about this delimimea. But all we can do is wait. Its not like we can drive to IGG and yell at them for better service/quality/and knowledge. Its them. So It maybe weeks till Mythwar2 is back up (sadly). No mythwar online player knows for sure. So I don't know why Konijntje is saying &quot;It will be open on Thursday&quot;. Its Thursday morning for me right now. Nothing special. And If IGG is hiding the real release time then all we can do as players who want to play the game is open it, and try to log on.<br>
  <br>
  Not much we can do besides hope to the MythwarGod that we get our damn game so we may enjoy it dureing the closed/open beta.
