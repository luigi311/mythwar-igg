  since i'm first reply here. I think I would add some useful info regarding skills here:<br>
  <br>
  you need &lt;skill&gt; I to lvl <strong>25</strong> before you can upgrade &lt;skill&gt; II freely, otherwise &lt;skill&gt; II lvl cannot exceed &lt;skill&gt; I lvl.<br>
  you need &lt;skill&gt; II to lvl <strong>40</strong> before you can upgrade &lt;skill&gt; III freely, otherwise &lt;skill&gt; III lvl cannot exceed &lt;skill&gt; II lvl.<br>
  you need &lt;skill&gt; III to lvl <strong>50</strong> before you can upgrade &lt;skill&gt; IV freely, otherwise &lt;skill&gt; IV lvl cannot exceed &lt;skill&gt; III lvl.<br>
  <br>
  This applies to all individual skills. In other words, replace &lt;skill&gt; above with Death, Stun, Drain, Heal, etc. This has no effect across different skills, for example the level of Fire I has nothing to do with Flash II.<br>
  <br>
  Simple Examples:<br>
  <br>
  If you want Drain II lvl 20, you will need Drain I at least lvl 20. (20 &lt; 25)<br>
  If you want Chaos II lvl 35, you will need Chaos I at least lvl 25. (35 &gt; 25)<br>
  <br>
  Complicated Examples:<br>
  <br>
  If you want Frail III lvl 20, you will need Frail I at least lvl 20 and Frail II at least lvl 20. (20 &lt; 25)<br>
  If you want Heal III lvl 35, you will need Heal I at least lvl 25 and Heal II at least lvl 35. (25 &lt; 35 &lt; 40)<br>
  If you want Speed III lvl 45, you will need Speed I at least lvl 25, and Speed II at least lvl 40. (35 &gt; 40)<br>
  <br>
  If you want Stun IV lvl 20, you will need Stun I at least lvl 20, Stun II at least lvl 20, and Stun III at least lvl 20. (20 &lt; 25)<br>
  If you want Death IV lvl 35, you will need Death I at least lvl 25, Death II at least lvl 35, and Death III at least lvl 35. (25 &lt; 35 &lt; 40)<br>
  If you want Ice IV lvl 45, you will need Ice I at least lvl 25, Ice II at least lvl 40, and Ice III at least lvl 45. (40 &lt; 45 &lt; 50)<br>
  If you want Fire IV lvl 75, you will need Fire I at least lvl 25, Fire II at least lvl 40, and Fire III at least lvl 50. (75 &gt; 50)<br>

  I tried to translate quite a bit in the past, but the nature of machine translation is such that I would end up doing something I rather dislike doing - and that is making mistakes.<br>
  <br>
  I've got the Ranks too... but I don't think they're right, for 1st reborn are there only 4 ranks? Second Lieutenant, Lieutenant, Captain and Major?<br>
  <br>
  3rd reborn is screwy too, because it lists another rank at 3-200... which to published knowledge, is unobtainable... but I'll look out for more stuff to bring to here.

  btw, i thought red rank is max 8 skills = 600, but that would be orange according to the chart.<br>
  <br>
  in CB, there was a time when a lot of people were staying red as they didn't do drow yet (couldn't find +5s). i didn't see much orange. then you saw people going from red to green. that's like maxing 16 skills = 1200, which is correct in the chart.<br>

  600 is still red according to the chart.<br>
  <br>
  When you're looking at it, the top line denotes the colour obviously, when your skill sum reaches the value beneath the colour, then your rank will change to that colour.

  <br>
  so white rank is 0-259, red rank is 260-799, etc.<br>

  On one of mine, I made all skills lvl75 and then relogged. I was Yellow rank. Would I need 1 more point to trip the green rank?<br>

  I think, I'm not totally sure where these ranks take effect. I seem to remember that some of them take place on the bubble, whereas others require a single point excension of the bubble.<br>
  <br>
  EDIT: Although, somewhere, I remember seeing a green rank Staff Sergeant screenshot somewhere...<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Would be interesting to find out when it launches <img src="images/smilies/default/smile.gif" smilieid="1" border="0" alt=""><br>

  I saw lots of green ranks towards the end of the test. Never levelled my characters or skills till last two days myself. I was too busy taking pics of pets,lol. So never got chance to get anymore gold to enable me to afford the next lvl up of a skill to 76.<br>
  Must be someone on here made green and knows how.

  How or when did you turn green dude? After all skills lvl 75 and relog? Did you do anything else after?<br>
  Like I said, I had all skills lvl 75 and still had 95m talent points to use up, but stayed at yellow after relog.

  hmm, that's what I thought.<br>
  <br>
  It may be dependant on how you elect to relog, whether you choose what would be a &quot;cold relog&quot; or a &quot;hot relog&quot;.<br>
  <br>
  There was always initially when the colour and rank scheme was first implemented, the colour would sort of hang around and the client for you would accumulate up until eventually you could reach Brigadier General with a purple rank (got a pic somewhere to prove it too), that was always solved by quitting all open clients and starting them up again.

  </div>Btw. I had all skills on lvl 75. None was missed. I still had 98m talent points and 500m of gold, so no reason to miss any.<br>

  </div>I'm not totally sure, 260 is the value that is quoted on the CN MW2 and I'd be somewhat inclined to agree with it, though I can always update if it's wrong... which isn't out of the realm of possibility since the other &quot;jumps&quot; are around the 200 mark - which may imply the red rank occurs closer to 600
