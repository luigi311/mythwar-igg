  <br>
  Finally its been annouced that the new Aries pet is to be released at the end of April. I have heard in chat certain peeps talking about it price, res, etc. I know they get prior info cause they told me about the xmas event before it was announced and also the Sent list etc.<br>
  Anyway, I'd like to suggest, if I may, could you possibly tell us all more about it. Price? Resistance, Gr etc.<br>
  Just wanna know whether its worth saving for or not. Look on it as a marketing opportunity, I know you like those.<br>

  stupid pet just another way for IGG to attract more money.....Hold out when mall isnt making enough money, +3 AoD's will be sold on the mall, So will Dietys and Saints.&nbsp;&nbsp;If nobody is spending money for the mall, IGG will naturally put what it can on the mall to boost sales..<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  I miss the good old days when +13 gems, Dietys, HB's, Icys and Oceanics were from events only <img src="images/smilies/new/f40.gif" smilieid="52" border="0" alt=""> .......<br>
  The good ole days.......When the game wasnt based on 'who spends the most&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/smilies/new/f81.gif" smilieid="57" border="0" alt=""> .......<br>
  The good ole days, when Oli used to laugh at me for dueling and deathing his cent <img src="images/smilies/new/f18.gif" smilieid="83" border="0" alt=""><br>
