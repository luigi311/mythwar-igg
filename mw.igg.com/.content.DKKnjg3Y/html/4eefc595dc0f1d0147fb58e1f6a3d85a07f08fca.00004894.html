  Normally it would be nice to see what was &quot;lucky&quot; enough to win so if someone could track the pics down or they could be put on the first post (like they should have been in the first place) Would make the people who entered see why they didnt win or maybe you like saying &quot;These people get the prize. Not important why.&quot;

  Bout 3rd places are just f14...I mean chibity's work is nice but c'mon are we going to see at least one love event that work with chin don't win something. It was used so many times, just got old.. Originality don't mean anything to IGG<br>
  And obaid's work.. I seen better love massages written on toilet door's.

  Angelicdamon, you already saw it last month if you were paying attention to the Valentines's Video Event:<br>

  Chins don't win all the time, even when it's 1200+ views VS. 233 views for the Popularity Award.<br>
  But alright, I'm sorry if I played the same card twice in a row. I'll blow the event out of the water with something original next time. <img src="images/smilies/new/f60.gif" smilieid="39" border="0" alt="">

  After being the judge at a looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooot of graphics contest, I wouldnt have chosen something as plain as 2nd place prize and obaid2's is reeeeeeeeeally pixelated <img src="images/smilies/new/f08.gif" smilieid="91" border="0" alt=""><br>
  <br>
  shouldve been based on creativity imo:<br>
  -if it's hand drawn (imho chibity shouldve won first place), or at least lineart/colorization based on a sketch<br>
  -if it's original (vookimedlo aka saggat-chan did a great job here)<br>
  -how much effort was put into it<br>
  the first pic off deviantart with a guy and a girl kissing + 2 mw avatar images may look 'cool' but I can do it in 5 mins=worthless<br>
  if someone starts to render some high quality 3d img down to the last pixel or make a lineart/colorization from a plain sketch going into high detail=pro<br>
  -if it got a good message<br>
  that's about 24%-30% of the image, but not enough to win<br>
  <br>
  not saying mine was godly, but better than some cards <img src="images/smilies/new/f86.gif" smilieid="82" border="0" alt="">

  *Chuckles* Thank you, Cat ^_^; Your original work was absolutely amazing as well.<br>
  Actually, I'm extremely happy that I got third place. 1st would have been dandy enough, and 2nd...? Ugh, I don't need another chinchilla. But 3rd! I got a Snowbear, which is extremely helpful for me because I'm a female cent. Female cents lack purge chaos which is very good for r15 and papa drow, so now I have that ^_^
