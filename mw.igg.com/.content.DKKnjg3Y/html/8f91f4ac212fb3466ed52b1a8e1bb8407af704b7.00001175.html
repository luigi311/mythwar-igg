  Rescue&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Are you frustrated because you've been imprisoned for PK? We want you to be happy while you are playing our games, so we have mapped out a plan to rescue all imprisoned players this weekend.<br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="blue">Event Duration:</font></strong> 3:00pm-5:00pm every Saturday and Sunday from June 20th to June 30th (Server Time)<br>
  <strong><font color="blue">Event Description:</font></strong><br>
  If players are imprisoned for PK during the event period, they can send an application for a rescue to our online GMs through the GM channel or LIVE CHAT. Players must leave information about their characters' names, characters' IDs and servers with the GMs. Once the relevant confirmation work has been done, GMs will start to rescue players out of their prisons.<br>
  Players rescued by the GMs will get rewards as well. Everyone only has one chance.<br>
  <font color="red"><strong>Rewards:</strong></font><br>
  <font color="red"></font>50 Fortune Bombing Integrals and 3 Mystical Fruit (1.5M Exp)<br>

  <img src="images/smilies/new/f86.gif" smilieid="82" border="0" alt=""> omg. Have you thought this through? The jails are going to be jam packed full of alts that have been pk'ing helpless players. I hope you have a coach laid on from the prison.<br>
  Still, at least it's something new. I will be interested to see the effect this has on players.<br>
  Well, MD off to stock up on blood now<img src="images/smilies/new/f18.gif" smilieid="83" border="0" alt="">

  GM's will save thier friends. Another way of indiscreetly giving out rewards to those they care about.<br>
  Time for event is limited. If loads of people end in jail, then surely it follows at some point there will be a choice of who, and not who to rescue. I better take a packed lunch and expect a long stay<img src="images/smilies/new/f86.gif" smilieid="82" border="0" alt=""><br>

  Yeah the gms told a couple people I know that they couldnt rescue them <img src="images/smilies/new/f10.gif" smilieid="42" border="0" alt="">.<br>
  <br>
  Of course they can't as was stated by someone that isnt me (<img src="images/smilies/new/f24.gif" smilieid="75" border="0" alt="">) the gms found another way to help their friends <img src="images/smilies/new/f86.gif" smilieid="82" border="0" alt="">.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course It doesnt bother me, I dont need an event to go pk people.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is <strong>QUITE</strong> hilarious for others to call you out and when you say ok watch them back out <img src="images/smilies/new/f10.gif" smilieid="42" border="0" alt="">

  i think GM's will have far to few ppl they can save in a fixed time<br>
  wich will make it kinda useless.
