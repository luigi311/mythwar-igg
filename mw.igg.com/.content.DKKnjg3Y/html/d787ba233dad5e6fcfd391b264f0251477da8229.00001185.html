  Again - this is a major step (for me) in improvement of the communication between IGG and the players.<br>
  <br>
  A major next step would be if didiao and the rest of the GMs would actually reply to posts with comments and questions listed here.<br>
  <br>
  The human avatars look great. Can we assume that all of the 2nd reborn avatars will be flying? I see wings (or the equivalent) on all 4 designs that were made public.<br>
  <br>
  And why we're stuck with the same Soul stones quests again? Why not make new quests for 2nd reborn, and even better on some new maps, availiable for players 120+??<br>
  A possible answer would be that the maps are not developed yet and there is no time to complete until Feb. Still would be great to hear.<br>
  <br>
  After all I've done reborn in mw (x2 wood, x2 bly, x2 seal etc), now I'm doing wood def, bly def, seal etc for my avatars in mw2. Then I will reborn and do it the second time, then with the option of 2nd reborn I'll have to go through the SAME quests for the 3rd time.<br>
  <br>
  It was a bit boring and repetitive to even write the above and I believe many players will agree that it will&nbsp;&nbsp;be times and times more boring to actually do those quests again and again and again <img src="images/smilies/default/smile.gif" smilieid="1" border="0" alt=""><br>
  <br>
  Didiao any thoughts on this? Any info would be greatly appreciated.<br>
  <br>
  Thanks!

  it would be cool if the icon pictures for your char would change when you rb<br>
  like&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  new&nbsp;&nbsp;quest for rb<br>
  i dont mine redoing soulstone quest but wood def and bly def and seal are so boreing and the grinding for lvl's only increase after reborn mAYBE INSTEAD OF HAVEING THE EXP U NEED INCREASE U COULD HAVE IT DECREASE IF&nbsp;&nbsp;WE HAVE TO DO THE SAME QUEST<br>
  (srry press caps lock by accident )<br>
  also on the website&nbsp;&nbsp;information&nbsp;&nbsp;for rb would be help&nbsp;&nbsp;like a gide on bonus extra rist all that to help new players plan there rb<br>
  also a soulstone guide and the title it gives and what pets can be used with what titles

  Thanks for replying.<br>
  <br>
  Getting some info on the official page about this would be great as well <img src="images/smilies/default/smile.gif" smilieid="1" border="0" alt=""><br>
  <br>
  After all 2nd reborn is not so tempting if it just means repeating everything that you have done 2 times already <img src="images/smilies/default/smile.gif" smilieid="1" border="0" alt=""><br>
  <br>
  Also - the higher the level, the harder the progress, OK, but still there must be a balance...<br>
  <br>
  Also opening up another city open for high levels would add another goal to fulfill for players - be among the ones who can actually get to there <img src="images/smilies/default/smile.gif" smilieid="1" border="0" alt=""><br>
  <br>
  I think the different icon for reb and 2nd reborn chars is great! <img src="images/smilies/default/smile.gif" smilieid="1" border="0" alt="">

  well umm.... I kind of like the male mage ...<br>
  <br>
  question...<br>
  <br>
  Is it just me? Or does the female mage head kinda look like Sha-Tee off of Star Wars? #14

  For those characters that choose to undergoe a second reborn, will the boosts they got from the first reborn still be in effect on their second reborn character, or will it be replaced by the second reborn's boosts. personally i think the second reborn's boosts should be added on, this way a character can plan to gain , say the resistances of a human reborn form their first reborn, and then couple that with say a centaur's health boost. I think it might add more incentive, because your characters could gain a lot more strength.

  </div>I agree with him the humans do look rather off...I'm a cent person myself though and I have to say yall did hell of a great job on them. Also the female borg I like her but does she really need the stuff on her back it throws her off a little like she over did it or something.<br>
  Anyways keep up the good work guys can't wait till I reborn and start working on my second. <img src="images/smilies/new/f02.gif" smilieid="78" border="0" alt="">

  I also think the fem mage looks a little bit to much off of starwars, i suggest giving her hair you know. Make her a little more sexy looking<img src="images/smilies/new/f19.gif" smilieid="87" border="0" alt=""> . Other then her head, I think its alright though.

  Borgs especially the male looks a little to much like transformers. I think if it were to be changed then I would make it a little more human like as at least my perception of a borg is half human half robot not just all robot.<br>
  <br>
  The humans look like Illdan of WoW even the male has the same weapon as him. They both look great but seriously it looks too similar. An idea I would ike to see is the male human becoming the paladin or dark armoured knight and the female becoming a thief looking character. Maybe giving them the same weapons as 2nd reborn just tuning them up a bit.<br>
  <br>
  Both mages in my opinion are great im not sure about the star wars thing as I haven't watched all of them...<br>
  <br>
  The Centaur/Elf images look good but goat angels??? I thought myth war 2 avatars had nothing to do with the centaur part anymore else what was the point in having a new avatar for mw2. In my opinion there should be just elven angels no horns.<br>
  <br>
  Well these are my <strong>opinions</strong> about all the races of 2nd reborn feel free to discuss<br>

  This is not centaur anymore. This is elf.<br>
  The male mage's wings look like a wing in 2moons/dekaron.<br>

  the new reborn characters are fine, the best are the cents, but mages might maybe need a litle rework, male mage looks like an animal, you should maybe put his little spirit friend on his back, it makes him look more powerful,<img src="images/smilies/new/f80.gif" smilieid="84" border="0" alt="">

  hi<br>
  i have a suggestion, i don't wanna play character like the male mage or the cent that have those horns like some demon, i wanna play a character that look like an angel and not like a monster, and kids play the game too, so i think it would be much better if u change those things about characters and make something that would feel ok to play with <img src="images/smilies/default/smile.gif" smilieid="1" border="0" alt=""><br>
