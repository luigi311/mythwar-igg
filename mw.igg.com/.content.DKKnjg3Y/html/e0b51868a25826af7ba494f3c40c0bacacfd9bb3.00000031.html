        <h2>Wondering</h2>Not to make any advertisement for other game host companies, but this is something I wonder!!<br />
        <br />
        I just saw an advertisement for IGG on another gaming-website ([url=http://www.battledawn.com/]link to that webby[/url])<br />
        <br />
        [size=1](if its removed from the website, dont blame me lol)[/size]<br />
        <br />
        the advertisement says:<br />
        <br />
        IGG -&gt; Angels Online -&gt; Tales of Pirates -&gt; Zu Online -&gt; Wonderland Online -&gt; Click Here<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        So I guess its clear what I wonder.. why isnt Mythwar promoted? some months ago I saw an advertisement about TOP on another game website.. never about mythwar.. at mythwar we have to promote the game ourselves with the line &quot;wouldnt u love it when more ppl come play this game together with you?&quot;<br />
        <br />
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
        <br />
        Next thing I wonder is this screenshot I took from the GODWARS forum.. makes me wonder how its an IGG made game..................................................... or is it just Skyunion? makes me confused<br />

        MW even under the SG days was never truly &quot;advertised&quot; on tinternet.<br />
        <br />
        Not everyone chooses to advertise, some things run so succesfully via word of mouth... Social Networking sites are usually a good example of this.<br />
        <br />
        Google's Orkut especially is one, I've never seen any info about it anywhere, until I watched the two co-founders discussing Google's success and some other things.<br />
        <br />
        How you choose to advertise also depends on the current success of your product and the kind of attention you want to draw to it.<br />

        Crony, I don't advertise for mw1 or &quot;promote&quot; IGG products.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, even after 3 years to see the &quot;development of the company&quot; I would rather steer new players toward something that will indeed appreciate and care for them f10.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know quite a few that I have warned that now they are &quot;in&quot; they get upset when things change or GM's dont help them.&nbsp;&nbsp;All they say is &quot;Shoulda listened&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;Im entirely too nice to them to say &quot;told ya so&quot; but they know im thinking it f45

        I see people rant, groam, whine, cry, hell they can even get actually angry due to this. It's a game, you play it, you can't live trough it, you gotta learn to live behind it... I understand the financial part behind it. You &quot;waste&quot; money, real life money which you &quot;hard worked&quot; to get. But its your own decision, if you decide to buy a PS1 would you cry to Sony to keep making games for that platform forever right?<br />
        <br />
        PS: If i started to steer away on my speech warn me and i delete my post f77 not that my opinion makes any diferent since i gave it like tons of times and i still see angry costumers.

        Actually Tech delayed it. Most likely there was a problem that would of been caused by the merge, so probably trying to work around it. Give it a few weeks, merge will still be going ahead.

        Could It be that they realized monetarily wise this doesn't work, as was previously pointed out f10.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows IGG is about $$$ so wouldn't it only make sense to kick some new stuff onto the mall first, give it another 4 months for everyone to run and buy them, only to merge the servers then (stupid me gave IGG another idea f75)<br />
        <br />
        Although I have to ask as to which side of the fence you are on because originally you had a problem with those in arch arguing about the time of the server, and other issues as shown below f10<br />

        Grow up? Stop being Childish?<br />
        Since mw2 has been released, many have moved to Mw2 as most have already stated.<br />
        Causing less players in both Arch and Missouri.<br />
        Merge would cause 1 server to have a high ammount of players.<br />
        <br />
        Time zone means nothing -_______- Why are you even using that as an excuse?<br />
        <br />
        Missing Guild Wars:<br />
        Geeze, Too bad. You didn't win the free EXP and +12 Gem.. Good thing they just had the Gem event, Could of gotten many +12 gems and +13 gems (+13 gems are better than +12 gems incase you didn't already know) Also, Whoever said Guild wars is the only place you can attack other people? I've seen several people goto Blython Church, Form their party, and just duke it out for fun.<br />
        <br />
        Missing Lottery? Oh psh, Lame prizes. What are you doing lottery for anyways?<br />
        Missing Crabs? Find another way to make gold, Forge or get lame EXP. [Can always spam theif quest for quick redeem points]<br />
        <br />
        All other events like Christmas, Halloween, That one with the wolves... They held a few times a day, So you will have a chance to do it eventually.<br />
        <br />
        Anyone complaining about this merge, Should perhaps find another hobby. Games are meant to be fun. Not something to stress over [/quote]<br />
        <br />
        But then they announced that the merge was cancelled or as we know postponed and you had the audacity to say:<br />

        Oh what the hell IGG? We were looking forward to the merge, This is so unfair &gt;.&gt;[/quote]<br />
        <br />
        So I now have to ask you were looking forward to the merge why?&nbsp;&nbsp;so that when Arch's guilds come over and there all mighty power guilds can get 25 people to show for war you can brag about beating them f85.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or are you just more interested in some of the wonderful equipments they have f10.&nbsp;&nbsp;News flash for you bladez/elusion/frosted, they won't be interested in trading those for [b]IN GAME [/b] items f10.&nbsp;&nbsp;So what were you looking forward to this merge for again f85

        <br />
        Nothing to do with guild wars. I'm not a Guild war fanatic, I just find it fun. Win or lose, Always fun. Just hate the people who actually get upset that they lost a fight and demand a pk fight as revenge? Eh?<br />
        <br />
        Anyways to the point, To have my equipments in Arch moved to Missouri Server ;) Where I can get the most use out of them.

        With video games we usually know EXACTLY what we're getting, and most video games are honestly more fun than MW1. Especially classics like Final Fantasy VI. Although I do agree with you in a way. A lot of those who complain about wasted money continue to buy from item mall, so now they only have themselves to blame for supporting a product they're not satisfied with. I myself still think there's some hope for MW1 if IGG gets their act together and does something to address the bugs and come up with more original and creative events (the kung fu panda event on mw2 is an example of an event done right, even if they did end up using a movie to make their event seem more fun). I think if someone isn't satisfied with MW1 then stop buying from the item mall, or better yet quit. If you have a lot of friends you'll miss you can use Trillian or some other IM program to keep in touch, or email or a million other methods, and yeah you'd be leaving your chars behind but if you don't like the game anyways and it's no longer fun for you then why bother playing?
