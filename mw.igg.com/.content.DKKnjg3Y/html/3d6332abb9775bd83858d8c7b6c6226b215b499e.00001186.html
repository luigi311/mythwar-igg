  is easy as yuo can see well my way to level up fast from 1 to 50<br>
  1-10 revive arena<br>
  10-15 snow ridge<br>
  15-20 sunset plains<br>
  20-25 southern rivage<br>
  25-30 badlands<br>
  30-35 bone desert<br>
  after this point you will level up faster doing race quest in elders zone it can be do it from lvl 20 so you can try combat areas or this quest from the level 20 and see what you prefer<br>
  lvl 50-60&nbsp;&nbsp;do wood def is better than areas is located at revive arena entrance a archer guy called defender<br>
  lvl&nbsp;&nbsp;60-70 bly def located in souther rivage entrance a soldier called defender too<br>
  lvl70-90&nbsp;&nbsp;seal at blython's bar<br>
  lvl90-101&nbsp;&nbsp;drow crusher(just 5 for day and need item to fight a +5 item is a little hard to get ) also you can do drowlord (another item +5) but is harder to defeat and need better skills<br>
  lvl 101-104 drow lord this 3 levels are not necesary for reb but add stats when you reb.<br>
  <br>
  and finally&nbsp;&nbsp;reborn&nbsp; &nbsp;whit reb char&nbsp;&nbsp;you start whit level 1-50 so go to wood def ender and do the same you do before well i just know it until 1-104 i supose you can do drow lord to get more level well this was my killer guide
