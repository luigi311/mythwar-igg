  1. All participants must post replies including a clear indication of the BUG. Otherwise, they will be disqualified.<br>
  2. It is much better for participants to give details about bugs, such as the map where bugs are found, a bug's coordinates, and a bug's type. If the bug is related to a computer system, offer us your computer configuration. Bugs found will be invalid if we fail to verify them because of insufficient information.<br>
  3. We will record every valid bug. If bugs of same type are found, the first post to submit them will be recorded. Don't repeat posting replies of the same bugs.<br>
  4. Participants can submit as many different unique bugs as possible in each of their posts to reply.<br>
  5. Bugs submitted are invalid after the event period expired. The event duration will be announced on our official website.<br>
  6. We will select 20 players according to the number and the quality of bugs they hand in and then present them with rewards.<br>
  7. We will release winners' forum usernames after the end of event. Winners must send private message to the appointed board manager to leave your account and contact information. We are not responsible for any losses resulting from incorrect contact information.<br>

  The Mall Promoter is bugged with a Length error, you can't answer the questionnaire and when you relog and talk to them you get told your answer is incorrect... I didn't get a screen shot, I have one however with the Toy Merchant in Blython, and I know that Hunter, Mercernary Chief and Toy give this error.<br>

  1: The reaction time is too fast. There's simply not enough time to get your mouse over, especially if you're on a laptop using a touch-pad mouse.<br>
  <br>
  2: The sword spider sometimes reads snow spider.<br>

  3: You may randomly enter a battle with no oppenent, monster, foe, ect.

  I am not sure that this is a real bug but it is a little mistake I guess:<br>
  When you make your route by clicking the name of NPC on your map, it is interrupted by a fight and it doesn't remember that you were going to the NPC after the battle end

  When you are fighting Nephetens in Revive, the next (second and third) battle comes right after the end of the previous one - you don't even have time to read the message of Nephetens.

  When you are choosing your skill in the battle, the &quot;skill choosing window&quot; disappears even when you click another place of this window, not only when you click the skill name.<br>
  ----------<br>
  After getting all four items for Stonesmith there were two messages: One saying that you got item 4/4 and the second one was empty (it should say something about that you got enough items I guess but there was nothing in it)<br>
  ----------<br>
  And same quest - when you go to Stonesmith to give him those items, it gives you exp right after the first clicking the Stonesmith, not after giving him items<br>
  ----------<br>
  During those starting quests - after finishing one there appear so many messages at once that you cannot read them all<br>

  I have the same errors as some of the others.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've gotten the same error Decode Macro Error (Length) a number of different times in Woodlingor.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lansquenet Offical (Skill Level Up Lvl 10 Quest), the entering of the password into the bank, talking to the fat little Porter guy, the quest for the New Horizon title, and the Hunter pet quest.<br>
  <br>
  I got the same error in Blython when talking to the Town Guide, and asked to talk about quests.<br>
  <br>
  ...I dont know why I get the errors - just that I do.<br>
  <br>
  Anyway I think the autorun pathing from the bank to the New Horizon guy needs to be adjusted - it makes you run into the Elder's Zone.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the autorun feature for the Hunter is broken.<br>
