  All players probably remember the hard times they had when they had just started playing a new game. No money, no pets, nothing. So, when you see a rookie asking for questions and for help, can you really stand idly by and do nothing? We hope not. So, join us in this event for newbies and make friends with all the new players. Help them get through the hardest part, the beginning.<br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="blue">Event Duration:</font></strong> October 11th - October 19th<br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="darkgreen">Play Flow:</font></strong><br>
  1. Players with the title of&nbsp;&nbsp;'New Horizon' can team up with players below Level 20. Then go to the Bar in Woodlingor at Server 1 and find a GM to register.<br>
  2. Players with the title of New Horizon must offer the GM the following details: ID and their teammates IDs. Registration will be complete after the GM finishes verifying the information offered. After that, participants can start playing game.<br>
  3. When players below Level 20 get to Level 30, the whole team can go to the Bar in Woodlingor at Server 1 and find the GM to claim their prizes.<br>
  <br>
  <font color="blue"><strong>Prizes:</strong></font><br>
  1. Players honored to be New Horizon will get 500k Gold when their teammates reach Level 30.<br>
  2. Players below Level 20 reaching Level 30 will get a Tri-experience Roll.<br>
  <br>
  <strong><font color="blue">Notes:</font></strong><br>
  1. Participants must team up to register and reclaim prizes. If the GM is away from the keyboard, please contact the GM via Live Support.<br>
  2. Every New Horizon player can team up with four players. More players in one team will earn participants more rewards. Participants are allowed to take part in this event repeatedly.<br>
  3. Our GM will confirm if the participating players are cheating by checking their participating IP. Once cheating is detected, the whole team will end up with no prizes.

  This could be a bad idea, since when they get their prizes with the level 20 newbies they could end up dumping them off to get more newbies under 20 to do the event again. Then again, 500k is nothing anyway, so most players probably won't even care<img src="images/smilies/new/f77.gif" smilieid="73" border="0" alt="">

  </div>Actually, you are wrong. It is quite far from impossible to find at least 3 other people who will stick the whole day with you... Lots of people take note of what is said on World Chat will steer away from jerks etc... you just have to look. I found a party ages ago that I used to go from 16 to 42. same 4 people and all 4 were new.<br>
  <br>
  I do conceed that it is hard to find as I mentioned, but it's not impossible.

  <img src="images/smilies/new/f77.gif" smilieid="73" border="0" alt=""> not every one plays 24/7 sparkblaze&nbsp;&nbsp;no real newbi will stay that long it say's they will receive 500k gold when there teammates reach lvl30 try keeping a team of new players that long the prize is not worth it maybe before the aod/pet event it was but after that event thing arent as low priced as before<br>
  <br>
  Poepchinees the newbi's dont get 500k gold read the top<br>
  <br>
  just so u no i tryed doing it with a party of alts useing double exp i only reached lvl 22 and that was playing all day for game based on haveing to restart all over again 3times the exp is really bad<br>
