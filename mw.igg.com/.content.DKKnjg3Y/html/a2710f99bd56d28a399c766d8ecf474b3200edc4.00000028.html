        <h2>Last moments at MW2 before i leave</h2>eh as some of you know im kinda tired o mw2 and well mw all together because the ignore feature is weird. some people are disrespectful and tell everyone about obscure things like their 14 year ld sex life and how you should nail their sister. plus how ridiculously long it takes to get a party for ss. AND how some people in closed beta are more intuned with telling what they did saturday then testing the game through reborn system quests and new areas(because its closed beta and thats what you do) which is kinda funny.<br />
        <br />
        So i was walking around in some of my favorite maps and found some rare pets that will take people quite a while to catch/own and thought i would get some screen shots of them. first is chaotic devil next is lion dragon.<br />

        you should post a screen shot of there stats&nbsp;&nbsp;the holy dragon the yellow title doesn't even look right and it doesn't say like &quot; ##$#^#'s pet&quot; , and the chaos demon doesn't have any title at all. I'm not calling you i liar just want to see growth rate and stats for both.<br />

        Moral of the story: NPCs can't be captured as pets.

        ye i never said they were my pets cvept in lion dragon screen shot where i thought id be kinda kool and say that, i was refering to mw1 where you could own them as pets and i found them on the mw2 maps obviously with different names but known by the looks as chaotic demon and lion dragon so i took pictures haha.

        <br />
        @ AAEricpeterson: next time post full sceenshots instead of your cut up photoshop version, your first post reads like you were implying you HAVE these pets, when in fact they are NPCs, and if you play the game enough you would know that any NPC, or quest monster can't be captured as a pet. Also it is called a Holy Dragon, not lion dragon... I know, my wife and I have 2 of them in MW1.<br />

        <h2>Just a tip</h2>You don't need any type of screen hunter program to capture a screenshot... Every keyboard has a print screen button:<br />
        <br />
        [IMG]http://i156.photobucket.com/albums/t23/MythWar/PrintScreen_small.jpg[/IMG]<br />
        <br />
        so unless the button is missing or broken ([i]in which case buy a new keyboard[/i]) all you have to do is push the &quot;prt scr&quot; button and the full game client window will be saved in the MythWar_en folder located in your&nbsp;&nbsp;computer's program files.<br />
        this is what would be saved:<br />
