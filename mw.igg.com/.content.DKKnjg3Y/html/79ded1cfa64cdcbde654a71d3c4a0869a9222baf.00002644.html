The first two players will find their own GM to make a new team. Now each group is composed of one player and one GM. Then two lucky players will go along with the GM to race to the Newbie Guide in Sky Passage. During the journey GMs are not supposed to beat monsters and players are not allowed to use devils tear to avoid the monsters as well. If the GM dies, it means the group fails, the other one will win. If both of the GMs die, it means this-time quest fails. The event will be held again. Winners are the ones who can reach the destination the fastest.<br>
                                <strong>Reward:</strong> Winners will obtain a chance to ask GMs to help him for survival quest on December 9th. We are not sure which round we would get to but we will try our best. ^^<strong></strong></p>
