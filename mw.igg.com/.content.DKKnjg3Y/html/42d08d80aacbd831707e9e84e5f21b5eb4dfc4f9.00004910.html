                  I'm sorta retreating from mythwar to try out other games. What I have noticed that is unique about mythwar is that you really become a person there. Other players get to know you for what you do, and it's fast for the world to know you, not just your close friends and guildies only. For the other games I tried, I still do not know anyone famous out there yet.<br>
                  <br>
                  So I kinda want to make this hall of fame for those who made their names widely known in the game either for their unique accomplishments or by other means. My criterion is vaguely something like if the name is mentioned, the players during some period of time will recognize the name and what that person has done. And I try not to include recognition of bad doings.<br>
                  <br>
                  With all that said, I'm still a human and my opinion is subject to biases. Don't take it as a personal offense if your name is not here. I only assume what most players are thinking and by no means the voice of majority of the players. Each player has his own personal accomplishments and those are what we should respect. To be known widely is a different matter. Could just simply mean they started playing early and had more luck. Nevertheless, it does not hurt to put them here for good memory.<br>
                  <br>
                  Without further ado:<br>
                  <br>
                  *Note1: Feel free to nominate someone (not yourself please). I will decide if appropriate. No flaming please.<br>
                  *Note2: I put (?) where I'm not sure of the info. If you know for sure, please let me know. I will correct the info and remove the (?)<br>
                  <br>
                  ============================================================================<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">Alenia</font></strong> - Alenia is a sentinel and the Shinsei commander. He is very friendly and helpful in settling conflicts. Although he does not make much appearance in world chat, he has helped many behind the scene. Alenia's team is currently one of the best teams in guild wars. Beating <font color="darkred">meh and Elazul</font> party during the last couple guild wars, his team with <font color="darkred">Hayades, Prue, Loyda and Loybitz</font> is sure holding the strongest team in guild wars up to date. Alenia's best pet is a Howling Beast named bankai, showing her fond of Bleach.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">Az and Cas</font></strong> - Az is a legend. Despite having comparative high ID than most in this list, he managed to secure the first rank for an extended period of time. His leveling speed is insane. I believe he is the first to spam Papa Drow not using hypno strategy. That together with his Guild Quest choring speed makes him a legendary player. Az has the first reborned Ant Eater with high crit, showing how a cheap pet can be extremely powerful. Az is a Sunkist member, although he is pausing from the game saying there is no new content. Cas is his alt.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">Balde and NVS_H0E</font></strong> - Balde is the only player in possession of Chaos Wisp deity pet on server. She also has two Howling Beasts inherited from her friend NVS_H0E who left the game quite early. Balde is known to be an outspoken person, often with dirty jokes. Now she stops playing but has her brother who used to play on another server play her character instead.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">Bathazar</font></strong> - Bathazar is the only person on server in possession of Necklace of God. He spent at least a month to train his alts (so called Mantis Army), at low levels, to get enough points to redeem the necklace at Blython Chruch. Without him, we might never see this necklace ever. The experience of doing Help Newbie quests, along with his other unique experieces, also greatly contributed to his blog, which won the Blog Contest Event. Bathazar was a known mall item buyer and consequently very rich. He is probably the person with most Ghoul Spirits up to date.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">batusai</font></strong> - batusai is the founder of Genesis guild. During his reign, Genesis expanded greatly, merging in many guilds such as Zeth, FallenPandas and Latino to become one of the strongest guilds up to date. batusai is not as active anymore due to his job, but he is in close contact with <font color="darkred">Sparrowsong</font>, the current leader of Genesis and advices her on many occasions.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">Belladonna</font></strong> - Belladonna is the founder and leader of Shinsei guild. Currently level 4, Shinsei is definitely one of the two strongest guilds now on server. To hold such big family together is a feat in itself worth mentioning.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">Blitzkrieg</font></strong> - Blitzkrieg is always on <font color="darkred">Belladonna</font>'s side aiding with building Shinsei from scratch. He is a male human reborning into male mage since he wanted to try different role. He quit the game for personal reasons and now his account is controlled by Belladonna.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">BloodyMary</font></strong> - BloodyMary is a female human player who attains the green title (?). She was a part of Hellsing force back in the old time. She paused for a long time and let <font color="darkred">roman</font> play her character. She came back to play and is now in Genesis.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">Cat</font></strong> - Cat is the current leader of MiSfItS, a level-3 guild that still hold over 100 members nowadays, despite recruitment from the two polars: Genesis and Shinsei. Cat herself was scammed off her dear pets once but still continued to play the game with high spirit.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">chewbakla and team</font></strong> - only a few who played during that time would not have heard of this name. chewbakla was rich in game, yet he never bought mall items with real money. Most of his wealth came from smart trades. Utterly, he obtained a Berserker from trading. He was from FallenPandas (?) and later joined Genesis. While in Genesis, his party with <font color="brown">Ellie</font> was a force to be afraid of. Due to internal conflict, chewbakla left Genesis, and later joined Shinsei for a short time before quitting the game. (See his post reply below) He also created many high level alts, namely, <font color="darkred">PiNoY1, mystel and Astig</font>. Obviously from a pinoy :-]<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">Danzo</font></strong> - Danzo was one of the fastest humans of the first generation. Often seen around in speed SSP, he is a force to be afraid in guild wars back in those days where no one had chaos resist. His favorite pet is a ghoul, considered very rare during the time. He's leading Terror guild which later merged with THE_BROOD (founded by <font color="darkred">Ciam</font>) guild, one of the biggest guilds of the time. The guild is so big that they made a twin guild THE_BR00D (with zeros instead of O's) to hold more members.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">Elazul</font></strong> - Elazul is the number one on the top player list. In fact he was the first person to reach the max level of 1-124. A male human reborning into female human, Elazul held the fastest human position over a month, simply due to a big difference in level to other humans. Later, he changed his build and with AoD speed boots flowing into the game, other player has claimed this title. Elazul was originally from Zeth guild, a small guild which he created himself. It later merged with Genesis and Elazul has become a Genesis member since until now. Elazul was also active in world chat, helping people with questions and quests. He's often seen doing difficult quests with <font color="brown">yuuko</font> and <font color="darkred">meh</font> such as high round survival, as well as in guild wars. Other than that, he's often seen running around in Blython doing guild quest.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">Ellie and team</font></strong> - Ellie is one of the best female borgs, if not <i>the</i> best. He has a team of his own, composing of 4 of each race plus an extra cent (<font color="darkred">Liseli, Lirali, Argent and Eris</font>). While Ellie has accomplished a myraid of feats in game, the most noteable is the fact that he can spam survival round 14 with ease. Another great achievement is to be the first to attain &quot;Lord of the Winds&quot; title. I came to know him when he was in Genesis (from FallenPandas, I think). He's often seen going into guild wars with <font color="brown">chewbakla and PiNoY1</font> and survival with <font color="brown">Laurian</font>. Due to some internal conflict in Genesis, Ellie and Laurian left to start their own neutral guild called Lone_Wolves, not joining Genesis back nor going to Shinsei. Ellie also has the only one Dark Dream on the server which he won from the event.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">Hantu^Api</font></strong> - Hantu is the first person who can forge +10 weapons. He can also make +10 helms and armors. Although he's not the first who can make helms and armors, arguably he is the first person who can generate very high revenue from selling these clean gears. He's often seen busy in market chat and in Demon Square craftshop. He is a player from Malaysia. He's part of the &quot;Three Brothers&quot; composing of <font color="darkred">PetirBuas, Paichow</font> and himself. They were in Hellsing during its glorious day and one of the strongest party back then. Now, the three brothers are in Genesis. Not quite as active in game as before.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">Hayades</font></strong> - Hayades is the second person who reached 1-124. When <font color="darkred">Elazul</font> was first 1-124, Hayades was at 1-123. He is a formidable mage now and was even scarier back in the days when his level was a leap above other mages, with one of his skill I-IV maxed. Hayades is a close friend of <font color="darkred">Ljopa</font>. Sometimes controlling Ljopa, although he has his own male cent, <font color="darkred">Zeibel</font>. Hayades is in Shinsei almost from the beginning of the guild. Although the guild was outnumbered by Genesis back then, Hayades' team stood fighting until the end, beating many Genesis teams in a row. The team could even score by keeping attacking Genesis teams alternating with walking to get the stone.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">The Hoas</font></strong> - The Hoas composes of three female characters: <font color="darkred">HoaBangTuyet, HoaTaThan and HoaPhongThan</font>. The Hoas are the first generation top players. It was unclear to me whether they are a single player or three. The Hoas sisters helped many many persons getting skill III and IV during those old days. You can safely say they helped 90% of players killing Drow. HoaBangTuyet the female borg is also the first character to reborn. After reborning the character leveled to high level at an amazing speed. The Hoas took a lead in the top list during those old days by far; HoaBangTuyet was on the top list for months. The Hoas quit the game before having a chance to reborn the other characters. The accounts are now run by <font color="darkred">PyRO</font>, their friend and a Genesis member.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">ic4 and team</font></strong> - ic4 is undoubtedly one of the richest men on server. In one of the posts, he took a screenshot of his money, billions of gold, in bank. Claiming never bought mall item with real money, he got most of the gold from trades and spamming low round survivals with one-man full-party team of his own. ic4 is also the first person who got a Spirit Cat back in the time since when intelligent pets were still rare. ic4 is a close friend of <font color="darkred">Alenia</font>. While he was pausing from the game, he let Alenia control some of his characters. He is now in Shinsei. Also a forum moderator in California zone by the name demseatle.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">Imperion</font></strong> - Imperion is a reborned male mage who proclaims that he is riding a horse, not goat! Although <font color="darkred">rahvin</font> claimed he finally admitted it is a goat and post the screenshots of him admitting it. He still claims the screenshot is photoshopped.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">Krondora and team</font></strong> - Krondora is probably a player with the highest number of active alts, many of which he can run simultaneously (in order of 10 at a times). With massive use of alts, he is a supplier of items such as Mokka to many now and in the past. Krondora has 6 main high level characters - one of each race plus extra cent and extra mage. I do not remember all the names, but here are some: <font color="darkred">elizabeth, leaderboeshoe and cidd</font>. Back in the old time, Krondora is a part of Hellsing army. Fighting with his own one-man army with 5 Centaur Kings (named StaminaKingI - StaminaKingV) is a spectacular team to be reckoned with. Now that CKs are common, he changed to 5 Feral Wolves instead. Krondora changed guild many times. He was in and out of Genesis many times. He was in Shinsei and out once, once in MiSfITs and now back in Shinsei. Also, Krondora often growled at <font color="darkred">PetirBuas</font> for some reason.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">lady_d</font></strong> - lady_d was the leader of dragon_merc guild, a well known guild during its time. Her best pet is reborned Desert Bandit and later Ghoul Spirit. She lost her original account and started to play under the same name with different capitalization (?). She also used to argue with <font color="darkred">Sparrowsong</font> a lot over guild matters and being the strongest female cent.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">Ljopa</font></strong> - Ljopa was one of the top players. He is in the top 5 for a long time. Although his main achievement, in my opinion, lies in his being in Genesis and later Shinsei. Ljopa is responsible for rallying many to spam Guild Quests, which he himself did a lot, leading to guild leveling. Later, he is not satisfied with the philosophy of Genesis and thus left to join Shinsei during its early era and helped the guild greatly. During his last days, he allegedly left Shinsei and joined Lazy guild to lessen the stress and start leveling his own army. He soon after quit the game and left his account with his close friend <font color="darkred">Hayades</font>, who bought his character back to fight for Shinsei.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">Mamba</font></strong> - Mamba is a charming Latina reborned female mage (Mamba means snake) who is in close relationship with benevolent <font color="darkred">sage^_^</font>. She has in possession many rare pets including the first Sand Giant and the second Flame Phoenix on server. Mamba first made her name in Latino guild. Mamba-<font color="darkred">SoulMagic</font> mage duo was a stronger team in wars and quests. She moved to Genesis when Latino merged in but later left the guild over <font color="darkred">Yeyito</font>'s conflict. She's now with Shinsei and often seen partied with sage^_^ and sage_god. She has an alt named <font color="darkred">cuadaja</font>.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">mano</font></strong> - mano is the leader of Hellsing during its glorious days when Hellsing won guild wars for months and months. he stopped playing not long after the guild lost its edge.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">meh and jix</font></strong> - meh is the author of this page. See <font color="darkred">yuuko and Petch</font> for more information. meh is closely related to yuuko in real life and in game. He is the first to explore survival high rounds (higher than 10) using specific resist armors and usage of female borg's protect in quest and in wars. He is generally a strategist for the team in cracking hard quests. His favorite unique pet is a Hell Cat lvl 100 with fire resistance, which he used to first challenge and beat round 10 survival during the time most considered extremely difficult. meh used reborned Santa Princess in wars. jix used to be another player but gave account to meh long time ago and known as meh's alt since. jix is famous for the first cent to use a Santa as primary pet.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">Nami</font></strong> - Nami is one of the most long-termed sentinels. Although not as active as in the past, he often appeared to answer many questions in world chat. He had a Holy Dragon deity pet, only two on server - the only one belonged to <font color="darkred">Zeo</font> whose account was lost. Nami was in Hellsing and once took role of leader before its downfall. Now Nami is with Shinsei.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">PD76</font></strong> - Having his name from Purple Dragon, PD76 is one of the early-day speed humans. Usually wearing full agi gear, his speed was said to be second to none. He was with FallenPandas then Genesis and later moved to Shinsei due to some internal conflicts. Sometimes during his play, he made his own one-man full-party team. He is also known for spending quite a bit on item mall.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">PetirBuas</font></strong> - PetirBuas is one of the first persons to reborn. I believe he did so only second to <font color="darkred">HoaBangTuyet</font> (?). He occupied the third rank seat on the top list for a long time - at least until before chocolates came into item mall. His leveling speed and skill training are remarkable. He is the first cent to achieve high reborn level and light blue rank. He is one of the Three Brothers (see <font color="darkred">Hantu^Api</font>). Like Hantu^Api, PetirBuas was in Hellsing and now with Genesis.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">PsychoAngel and team</font></strong> - PsychoAngel was the leader of HeavenlyAngels guild. Although the guild never leveled, it was quite stronge at the time despite being relatively new. PsychoAngel has her own army; <font color="darkred">PsychoGranny</font> is one. She also usually engaged in lovey conversation with her &quot;hun&quot; <font color="darkred">VoodooGoblin</font>. She quit playing together with VoodooGoblin to try out another game. It is Mythwar loss of a charming personality.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">rahvin</font></strong> - rahvin is the most helpful person on the world chat when he plays. Although not a sentinal, he kindly and promptly answers most questions with accuracy. His favorite word is &quot;moo;&quot; some people believe he's a cow... jk. Now that he has started working, he's not quite active as in the past.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">Razenator</font></strong> - Razenator is the first strength borg to reborn. He is also one of the first to achieve dark blue title. He was very famous back in the day due to the fact that he dueled a lot. On many occasions he also caused havoc such as spamming guild chat, flaming and spamming local in crab pit. He got muted on many occasions. Nevertheless, he made his character known and many adore him for who he is (newbies, don't copy him). He was with Empire and after a long drift, now with Genesis (?). He's often seen with his brother <font color="darkred">chaosdruid</font> and other Empire members.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">RikKu and Takacchi</font></strong> - RikKu is the most active sentinel, at least until lately. He always answers questions with his trademark color of light blue. RikKu was very active back in the day and helping a lot of people. He has been a sentinel for the longest. Takacchi, his strength borg, was hacked (together with <font color="darkred">sStorMm</font> account) and that marked the day RikKu paused from Mythwar. He is back now in game. He was from FallenPandas and now in Genesis.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">sage^_^ and sage_god</font></strong> - sage^_^ is one of the biggest supporters of MW item mall. His nickname is &quot;daddy.&quot; In close relation with <font color="darkred">Mamba</font> and couple other players in game who call him daddy. sage_god is his other character sometimes played by his real life daughter. He was in Mamba usually - from Latino, Genesis and now Shinsei.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">Sky</font></strong> - supposed to be one of the best (male) human players in the first generation, who were partying with <font color="darkred">the Hoas</font> a lot. He was hacked and consequently quit the game. Recently he came back with a new character named <font color="darkred">sky07</font>, a female character, now in Shinsei guild.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">sLaSh</font></strong> - sLaSh is the first person on server to own a saint pet Flame Phoenix (only two on servers so far) which he received from winning a forum event.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">Sparrowsong</font></strong> - Sparrowsong is the current leader of Genesis guild. The only lvl 5 guild on server thus far. Sparrowsong is known to be a fair leader and respected by the guild members. To carry the guild to such level is a feat in itself and well worth mentioning. In the past, she's the voice of the guild arguing against many accuses on the guild members. She usually said something to the extent of &quot;my guild members are not dogs; I don't put collars on them and tell them what to do.&quot; She's also nicknamed &quot;Oops queen&quot; as she often speaks in wrong chat channels, sometimes with embarassing topics.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">SoulMagic</font></strong> - SoulMagic is Latino guild ex-leader. Though never winning guild wars, Latino was a very powerful guild during the time; it never missed semi-finals. Although internal matters of the guild is not much known (due to language barrier), Latino later merged with Genesis and SoulMagic had became part of Genesis since. SoulMagic is in close term with <font color="darkred">Mamba</font> since they were in Latino and in Genesis, and they always did a lot of regular quests together including Drow 5 times with scrolls. SoulMagic's best pet is a bee with melee resist, which seems to be better than an average bee for some reason (he claimed it is not a killer bee). Last I saw him successfully added 5 crystals to this bee, each with +13 melee. He later quit the game. Rumors say he deleted his account (or grimreaper) (?)<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">Tanis</font></strong> - Tanis was the beloved leader of Sunkist. One of the big guilds during its time. The incident which made him known across servers occurs at the sentinel election when someone pretended to be him spamming other servers to vote for him. Many, me included, believe that it was not his own doing and was one of his guild members with good intention. The spammer's name was never mentioned and Tanis insisted that the whole incident be forgotton.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">Turalyon</font></strong> - Turalyon has a unique personality in Mythwar. Let me not elaborate. He is a leader of Empire guild and largely responsible for holding it up until the guild is level 3. He is a big supporter of mall items - first to use chocolates to level up. He was on top 5 for quite some time. He also had many reborned pets including Centaur King, Fire Demon, Phoenix, Santa and a strength-based Howling Beast named &quot;Warbeast&quot;. He is an agi human with AoD speed boot high level and hold the fastest human as of late, worth the non-existent title &quot;God of Speed.&quot; Due to his personality, he has many quotes such as &quot;I'm borned Empire, died in Empire,&quot; and &quot;I want to marry <font color="darkred">Khadin</font>.&quot; He is still the Empire leader as of now.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">Vondor</font></strong> - Vondor is known as the world chat police. Supposedly, he reported many spams and cussing in world chat to live support and had many players muted for wrong doing - although many questioned his judgement and measure. Vondor used to curse a lot in world chat himself but later reformed himself to repent for his sin by acting world chat police under sentinel <font color="darkred">VoodooGoblin</font>'s support. He is also the only one person known to have his name changed - from VondorWhore (a band name) to simply Vondor by contacting the GMs.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">VoodooGoblin</font></strong> - VoodooGoblin is a sentinel known for his rule-with-iron-fist style. He was a big supporter of item mall back in the old days. He only took big order and thus many of poor players put up their orders together then asked him for their supply. VoodooGoblin supported <font color="darkred">Vondor</font> and is in love with <font color="darkred">PsychoAngel</font>. He has long quit the game to try out other games but sometimes appeared back to check things out.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">XxMysticalxX</font></strong> - XxMysticalxX is the Dragon Balls King. During his prime time, it was very rare that he did not get the 7th ball. When he actually did it, he could take more than half of the balls spawned. It is a truly unique skill. He is a rather quiet lad who is currently a Genesis member.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">yuuko and Petch</font></strong> - yuuko has accomplished so much in the game, at least, on par with <font color="darkred">Ellie</font> and team. Together with <font color="darkred">meh, jix and Elazul</font>, she managed to beat Survival round 16, the highest record without GM help. She also attempted round 17 a couple times but without success. The whole same team also got the title &quot;Lord of the Winds&quot; and beat the prison guard with help of an extra cent such as <font color="darkred">roman</font> and <font color="darkred">SilverTooth</font>. Petch is yuuko's alt, a dark blue major reborned female borg on server. yuuko herself is a dark blue major as well as meh, jix and Elazul. They are the first dark blue major full team ever partied and hold the unbeatable record in guildwars for Genesis for many months before lately losing to <font color="darkred">Alenia</font>'s team.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong><font color="green">Zeo</font></strong> - Zeo is one of the most famous players early at the start of the server. He is disliked by many due to the manner he spoke in chat (please refer to his reply below). His favorite pet is a Ghoul Spirit, a rare pet during the time. He later won Holy Dragon from event but did not have a chance to put it to much use before he lost his account. He also had a first known bugged reborn Crazy Bandit, named &quot;Snowboarder,&quot; the name he later used for his character after he lost the account. Zeo is also known as the first to successfully build himself as a blood human, as opposed to full agi human trend during the time.<font color="darkred"></font>

                <div id="postmessage_76282" class="t_msgfont">Just recently checked forums. Kinda miss this game now <img src="images/smilies/default/sad.gif" smilieid="2" border="0" alt="">&nbsp;&nbsp;This list just brings back all the good memories I had when I still played (Sucks I missed the greatest Guild Wars of all time between Gen and Shinsei). Well meh, it was fun to know you and all the peoples in Mythwar but now that school started, there's definitely no chance of me coming back either.<br>
                <br>
                Best Wishes to<br>
