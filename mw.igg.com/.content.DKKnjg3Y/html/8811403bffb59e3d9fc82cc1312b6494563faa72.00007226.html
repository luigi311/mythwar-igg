                                            A) Yes, this is very normal, as the main character is allowed to keep a few pets. Pets will always be able to level up faster than the main character.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            <strong>Q) How many pets can a character keep?</strong><br>
                                            A) Every main character can keep up to 8 pets and there will be an increment of 3 pets after every reincarnation. The advantages of keeping multiple pets are: a) being able to use different pets for different battles; b) being able to trade your pets with other players.<br>
