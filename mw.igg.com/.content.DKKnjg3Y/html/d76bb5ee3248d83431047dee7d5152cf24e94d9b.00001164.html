        <font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">We are very happy to announce that the new edition of Myth War, the first ATB turn-based MMORPG in the world, will be released this summer. Today, we will be introducing some of the cool new features to you.</font></font><br>
        <font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"></font></font><br>
        <strong><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"></font></font></strong><br>
        <strong><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="blue">Feature One: Character changes</font></font></font></strong><br>
        <strong><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"></font></font></strong><br>
        <font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Characters in the new edition will be not so gentle any longer. The Male Borg and the Male Mage are even more outstanding now with their handsome new equipment. Even the Female Centaur has the feeling of being combat ready around her whole body. The delicate characters, exquisite lighting and shadow effects, vivid character veins and exact actions are some of the more important improvements in the new edition. It is no wonder that some players consider it to be almost a whole new game.</font></font><br>
        <strong><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"></font></font></strong><br>
        <strong><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><font color="blue">Feature Two: Maps change</font></font></font></strong><br>
        <strong><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"></font></font></strong><br>
        <font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">The maps are absolutely amazing in the new edition. They are created using 3D models and 2D paintings. One big change is that players will be born in peaceful Woodlingor, not the familiar Sky Passage. The familiar Blython, Revive Arena and other maps have great changes as well. Meanwhile, Sunset Plains and Outcast City have been redrawn. Only powerful players can experience all the wonderful scenery.</font></font><br>
        <font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">A brand-new interaction mode will be released in the new edition as well. It will continue to offer players a perfect Rarus world with a unique method. More choices, more freedom and more fun await you. Each character is a leading actor and we are all just players on this virtual stage. What are you waiting for? Come on and join us in Myth War 2.0.</font></font><br>

  I believe they already said that nothing will transfer as it is a whole new game.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do know that to fully play the game, you will need to use the item mall or buy the stuff from players that use the item mall.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have the feeling that unless i have a new computer by then, I will be mildly lagging in the game even with only 1 character.<br>
  <br>
  It does look pretty nice though, so I probably will play it, I am just not sure how much I would play.

  my friends and i won't play any longer if no tranfer is going to happen.... both myself and them are MW and igg supporters and buy mp's... and if this is made with no transfer i see it as a brutal stab in the back both for igg custumers and regular players that spend only their time to improve

  Things do transfer, someone with some &quot;superior knowledge&quot; was nice be informative.&nbsp;&nbsp;IGG has been back and forth over what will transfer, Whether it will just be the &quot; Promoters&quot; or VIP members + Promoters.<br>
  <br>
  Either way some stuff will transfer....dont worry though, wait til your pet gets stolen <img src="images/smilies/new/f86.gif" smilieid="82" border="0" alt=""><br>

  Honestly, you get a brand new game which you were all complaining about that it wasn't released already and now you complain that you <strong>might</strong> not get everything what you accumulated over years (still only bit and bytes tho).<br>
  Come on, get the point of playing / strarting a new game.<br>
  Take Diablo II for example: there are &quot;seasons&quot;. This means <strong>all</strong> all players start at zero again. And know what? That's so f***ing great, because then you have what you all <strong>claim</strong> to demand: fair chances for everyone. And now you <strong>might</strong> be getting this and *surprise* *surprise* <strong>complains</strong> <img src="images/smilies/new/f77.gif" smilieid="73" border="0" alt="">

  </div><img src="images/smilies/new/f78.gif" smilieid="72" border="0" alt=""> I resent that Dragonroost <img src="images/smilies/new/f25.gif" smilieid="61" border="0" alt=""><br>
  Ive complained constantly since MW1 became about the mall even though f2p.&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfering of stuff, yeah it would be nice (considering with mw2 we get 2nd reborn).&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to get a &quot;fair&quot; shot at anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;People cheat, its a given <img src="images/smilies/new/f10.gif" smilieid="42" border="0" alt="">.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to make it a &quot;fair&quot; shot at anything is to make it a cheating free environment....something IGG and nobody can successfully do.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing newer players want a &quot;fair&quot; shot at is the &quot;superior pets&quot; and the great things that this game entailed before IGG managed to f*ck it up beyond repair <img src="images/smilies/new/f10.gif" smilieid="42" border="0" alt="">.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  To really say that People that havent been around 2+ years dont deserve a transfer is relatively unfair.&nbsp;&nbsp;While some definitely wouldnt mind doing it all again....Others have sat around too long to even remotely want to go thru the whole level 1 thru 104 light blue reborn then 1-15 thru 1-124 dark blue again, just to get a 2nd reborn.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no Guarantee that MW2 wont end up like this game.&nbsp;&nbsp;Really how successful are games that <i>REQUIRE</i> constant use of mall.&nbsp;&nbsp;Really when you stop and think about it, it actually would be more entertaining for people to go spend the $15 a month or whatever to play WoW or whatever, then to pay that money on MW2 after seeing exactly what happened with MW1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthering the angst against that would be the fact that for the last year, to keep money coming into the game, IGG dangled everything they possibly could on the mall to keep people spending <img src="images/smilies/new/f10.gif" smilieid="42" border="0" alt="">.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  At least with WoW and games like that your paying for a game that will continue, and they at least attempt to fix any problems with programs on the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;When was the last time you heard or saw of IGG fixing it here.&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold hack of last june/july <img src="images/smilies/new/f45.gif" smilieid="79" border="0" alt="">.&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember the Zerkers that started showing up on Alps <img src="images/smilies/new/f17.gif" smilieid="92" border="0" alt="">.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll gladly PM you to inform you how that stuff happened <img src="images/smilies/new/f86.gif" smilieid="82" border="0" alt=""><br>
  <br>
  IGG has the opportunity to run MW1 and MW2 on 2 different sets of servers <img src="images/smilies/new/f10.gif" smilieid="42" border="0" alt="">.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most everyone from MW1 will at least try out MW2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most will just like the look and thats about it <img src="images/smilies/new/f10.gif" smilieid="42" border="0" alt="">.&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer everything over people will cry.&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove everything that some people have played 2+ years for, and watch them leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the people that I know on Missouri that were actively playing spent money on this game pre last Valentines Event.&nbsp;&nbsp;Alienate all of them, which with transfer to MW2 would bring you in more money.....doubt that would happen............What decision would you make?&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn down guaranteed money, in hopes that people will come back and pour more in again /<img src="images/smilies/new/f85.gif" smilieid="80" border="0" alt="">

  I'm a none payer, i worked my ass out in the game gathering mokkas, DTDs and nelsons, trading pets to make a living.<br>
  But there are people that invested real money, and to become a VIP you have to spend thousands, how are those guys going to feel?<br>
  Imagine someone that just bought 5000 MP, expecting to buy items to trade in game, and now he finds out that in 2 months they are worthless.<img src="images/smilies/new/f36.gif" smilieid="111" border="0" alt=""><br>

  I agree with Smokey. People are naturally concerned about hard work and time and investment they have put into MW1.<br>
  Obviously with the introduction on MW2 concerns will be for what this is all now worth to them.<br>
  I regularly go onto a UK forum where there are plenty of MW1 players. By our quick adding up, about 20 og them are either VIP or promoters or both like myself. If IGG think we will just shrug and lose everything and start again they are very very wrong. Already there are MW clone games on the net which are to some extent better. And as they are new resources are going to be put in and not taken out. So ask yourselves. Where do you think MW1 players will go to? MW2 or someone else. Speaking only for myself and not the rest can say this. Unless a clear and concise announcement is made very soon, I will never support IGG again. They are letting loyal players and members down who have made them rich and supported the finance to develop MW2. I think some kind of compensation or method of transfer should be without contest.<br>
  I await with baited breath.<img src="images/smilies/new/f77.gif" smilieid="73" border="0" alt=""><br>
  <br>
  ps.<br>
  Do you think I will be able to take my ball to the MW2 forum?<br>

  I don't understand you ppl first u crying about no updates and no info about MW 2.<br>
  Now they told us offical that they will relase it in summer, u telling only bullshit.<br>
  It's normal that there will be no transfer from MW I to MW II beacause it's almost diffrent game!!<br>
  Like some1 will cry about no transfer from Lineage I to II or GuildWar I to II..<br>
  Think about what u write and no1 force u to buy from item mall...I never spended even 1$ to item mall and i have few reb chars <img src="images/smilies/default/smile.gif" smilieid="1" border="0" alt=""> and no1 force u to play MW II u can play other game or go out from your house <img src="images/smilies/new/f80.gif" smilieid="84" border="0" alt="">

  </div>You're entitled to your opinion, just like evryone else. But answer me this please DR. How would you feel, having spent countless hours and money only to be a the same point as a brand new player. I don't begrudge players in MW1 who have items and pets that I will never get because they was there before me. Thats just the way things are. But for them to lose everything and be put at my level or worse is abborently wrong. Its a disgrace. Stop talking as a mod or IGG supporter and talk as a gamer. Otherwise just &quot;Mod&quot; and keep your comments to yourself and let the players have the forum.<br>
  Just my opinion.<br>
  If you delete, please move my ball to another post. Thanks<br>

  </div>Speculation it might be....but would IGG do something silly like that to one of its beloved &quot;<img src="images/smilies/default/titter.gif" smilieid="9" border="0" alt="">romoters&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;Im not talking the rich.igg.com promoters, Im talking the promoters who give ridiculous amounts of money to IGG.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is where my Info on transfer or no transfer comes from.&nbsp;&nbsp;Im fortunate to know a couple of those &quot;<img src="images/smilies/default/titter.gif" smilieid="9" border="0" alt="">romoters&quot; and thats what IGG has told them....Transfer will either be just those &quot;<img src="images/smilies/default/titter.gif" smilieid="9" border="0" alt="">romoters&quot; or the VIP's and Promoters.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  May 2006 Sky Union started to launch and operate MMORPG---Myth War Online.<br>
  This shows when IGG started operating Mythwar, history of IGG and Sky Union is available on their website.&nbsp;&nbsp;Which most people naturally look into a game before signing up <img src="images/smilies/new/f10.gif" smilieid="42" border="0" alt="">.&nbsp;&nbsp;So you auto know at this point there are people who have been playing this game for at least 2 years....<br>
  <br>
  To be a &quot;new&quot; player and feel betrayed is borederline Impossible when seeing how long the company has been operational.&nbsp;&nbsp;IGG could betray its promoters by a fresh start for everyone, but that would do more harm then good....by the way pm following shortly <img src="images/smilies/new/f10.gif" smilieid="42" border="0" alt="">

  DragonRoost - If you like to play all the time from scratch - then great for you. I'm from the type that doesnt want to do it. Also I wonder if diablo that you giving as an example has item mall. And if you loose the stuff you bought from there with the new &quot;season&quot;?<br>
  Rethoric questions of course. And one more thing - to all those that say &quot;you have always complained from MW1 and now there is MW2 and u complain again&quot;...<br>
  <br>
  Guys - most of us have complained from the lack of quests, maps, gameplay etc. Have u seen all those NPCs that tell u that they support a function that will be implemented soon?<br>
  I have never complained about the skill system. Spamming is one of the factors that separates the noobs from pros.<br>
  <br>
  Equality? Why should I, who have spent countless hours of spamming, skill seal and so on, shopped the mall etc be equal to a guy that is lazy to spam and doesnt want to support the game by shopping at mall? (I spend about $100 every month because this is my way to support IGG and thank them for the game that I love to play so much. I will stop when I feel that IGG has stopped supporting me - it is a mutual thing after all)<br>
  <br>
  And in a sense all are equal - we all start at sky passage at level 1&nbsp;&nbsp;- white ranked recruits. After that it is totally in your hands what will happen.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  And why putting some new maps and changing the skins of some of the chars makes the game a totally different one?<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  You wanna know a secret? I'm currently playing with the new race images. There is a mod availiable that does that.&nbsp;&nbsp;WOW! I play MW2 now!&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/smilies/new/f19.gif" smilieid="87" border="0" alt=""> Wow! I play a new game now!<br>
  <br>
  In other games the equivalent &quot;of the new game MW2&quot; is called an update. I don't see how adding more content, improving the gameplay etc can be called a new game.<br>
  <br>
  Anyways I dont think that IGG will do that to their loyal players. If it does - well I'm off to find another game and another developer that understands that loyalty works both ways!<br>
  <br>
  Rest of you can have fun with the IGG &quot;seasons&quot;. <img src="images/smilies/new/f20.gif" smilieid="88" border="0" alt="">

  How is it I can understand your way of gaming and attitude but you can't understand mine or others? Why call people on here whiners or complainers if thier opinions happen to differ from yours? Everyone has an opinion about this. New players and old. Not all will be the same. So you like to send 1-124 to reaper. lol I doubt that. But if you like to start over then thats all good if its good for you. But others haven't been here as long as you and haven't had the luxury of time and resources to have got to a 1-124 DB. So how about a compromise. You go MW2 and mod that forum and leave us whiners to worry about what is going to happen to MW1 and the hard work we have put in so far.<br>
  I'm not saying MW2 isn't awesome on the front of it. But if I wanted another game I would go and play one. I want to finish what I started here. Maybe if I can get to a level 1-124 DB I might think its time to change or play another. If MW2 is my choice then fair enough.<br>
  Just cause you've done it all here dude, don't bitch those who haven't.

  I only ever bought one thing from the mall using paypal and i had a bad experience with that as they couldnt find and then verify my payment, finally getting it sorted after 3 weeks constant mailing and talk on live support.<br>
  <br>
  MW2 to me is just more icing to an already stale cake, it is not a new game as some suggested as its format is based upon MW1, there is a lot of new quests npcs and different looking characters and someone metioned catching pets? I wonder how much the big net will cost us on the mall<img src="images/smilies/new/f86.gif" smilieid="82" border="0" alt="">&nbsp;&nbsp;Seriously though, its either you do or you dont want to play MW2 but im sure that at least 80% will at least try it out.<br>
  <br>
  Such a shame that they wont/cant transfer chars pets etc from MW1 and i do feel for those that bought loads of stuff from the mall, but at least they are still going to be there on MW1. All MW2 means is twice as much $$ for IGG, i would have preferred them to have updated MW1 instead of making alternative version.

  </div>Add roughly half to the minimum Processor, use a dedicated graphics card wherever possible and for good measure, an extra 128mb.<br>
  <br>
  However, the new style runs easier and less resource intensively than MW does currently, so you can more than likely get away with the same spec.<br>
  <br>
  MW &quot;2&quot; has changed a LOT more than what is visibly noticeable, from a serious play, it's evident. After trying to translate to english bits of MW2, if it were to come as an upgrade, then, the upgrade would be something like 400mb+ which is basically half of MW already, so for what it's worth, a repackage is perfectly acceptable.<br>

  i think graphics look crappy, but maybe it's just the image is low quality (even when you click to enlarge it). if they said this was like &quot;mythwar prototype&quot; before MWI then i would believe too. but honestly graphics isn't what i play for, so i couldn't care less. anyway, i'm waiting to see next announcements in the series since this is &quot;new changes 1&quot;. yup the next one is more informative.

  I suggest you people drop mw all together and either play wow and wait for wrath of the lich king to come out or try out age of conan both games&nbsp;&nbsp;you'll get a lot more fun out of the money you spend on it.<br>
  <br>
  The graphics don't look any better than mw1 graphics, and you can already get the new graphics of the races if you just find them somewhere on the internet. I can guarantee within 1st couple weeks you'll have explored everything in mw2 just like mw1. IGG just wants mw2 because its heavily based on the mall which makes them more money possibly. I can not understand why you guys will play another game IGG runs. Hasn't one game been enough of a wake up call that tells you IGG can't run a game successfully and could care less about the customer even if that customer spends thousands of $$.<br>
  <br>
  I'll suggest this again go play world of warcraft or try out age of conan both games have potential. MW's potential has been dragged out to the pasture and shot in the head as soon as IGG took over the control of it.

  I have to also agree with Smokey, to not have a transfer after all these years of effort and spending cash that I work my ass off to get on MW1 would force me to think IGG wants me to quit playing all together!<br>
  <br>
  1. To not have a transfer will mean no stability for the games future because when the 3rd reborn is released we might have to start all over again so no1 will want to invest in the second rb.<br>
  <br>
  2. Players will feel like they are being done wrong by and will quit.<br>
  <br>
  3. With a player complete transfer everyone who currently plays will stay and continue to spend money on Mall Points because of all the new things they will want and to get the 2nd reborn, meaning players who spend now will continue to spend then.<br>
  <br>
  4. New players will still come and join because of the new game look and will be helped by the older players who still have all there posessions who will be able to give new players items which encourages players to stick around due to the kindness factor and making new friends.<br>
  <br>
  5. Simply put, no matter what, the benefits of a complete player transfer will always outweigh the benefits of not having one, IGG will gain new players to the game, old players will stick around and item mall sales will boom with both new and old spending. However to not have a transfer will discourage ppl from wanting to continue playing MW, instead of players trying to convince their friends to quit games like WoW and come try the new MW2 they might even go and play WoW. This means without a transfer IGG will be pushing away not only old players who they know spend on item mall but the friends of those players who might be willing to join and spend on item mall.<br>
  <br>
  <strong><u><i>IGG are a business, just like any other and they will surely bring out a complete player, item, pet transfer because simply put it will make them over 5 times what not having one will do!</i></u></strong><font size="4"><br>
  <br>
  <font size="5">OPI = value 75%&nbsp;&nbsp;-Old Players who want to keep what they invested<br>
  OPD = value 25%&nbsp;&nbsp;-Old players who dont mind starting again<br>
  GP&nbsp;&nbsp;= value 25%&nbsp;&nbsp;-New players attracted by graphics<br>
  IP&nbsp;&nbsp;= value 25%&nbsp;&nbsp;-New players attracted to game by OPI<br>
  TPT = value 100% -Total players to date<br>
  TPW = Total players after transfer<br>
  <br>
  If no transfer-<br>
  TPT - (OPI + IP) + OPD + GP = TPW<br>
  100% - (75% + 25%) + 25% + 25% = <i>50% of TPT will be TPW (50% less item mall sales)</i><br>
  <br>
  With complete transfer-<br>
  TPT + (OPI + IP) + OPD + GP = TPW<br>
  100% + (75% + 25%) + 25% + 25% = <i>250% of TPT will be TPW (2.5x item mall sales)</i><br>

  They are unable to transfer the data because they are 2 different games. Saint Beasts have 1.4gr, you are able to forge equipment similar/better than some aod's, mall point items are non tradable however there is a in game system which allows mall pts to be traded etc etc etc...<br>
  <br>
  A different company develops myth war not IGG. The developer is no longer going to develop myth war 1 as myth war 2 is already lots of times more popular than myth war 1 (CH version ID's are in their millions). Therefore you have two options:<br>
  <br>
  1 - Stay MW 1 and only release new pets and a few mall items.<br>
  <br>
  2 - Go to MW 2 get new content and lots to do but start again from lvl 1.<br>
  <br>
  1-124 D Blue, Saint beast and +5 aods you think your the only one losing out? I'll gladly choose option 2.<img src="images/smilies/new/f80.gif" smilieid="84" border="0" alt="">

  Umm...I don't care so much about level and skill level. I will level up and spam my skills relatively fast. I start new chars all the time so I'm used to spaming or whatever mundane task it will be to up the skill.<br>
  <br>
  I'd hate to see my +5 aods and rare pets that I have won on bombing go...And I dont think that is very hard to transfer.<br>
  <br>
  If they don't - they better close out the mall for now coz I'm not making an informed decision wether to buy a Taurus or an Aries or more generally speaking - when I buy an mp card.<br>

  All the pics of MW2 are looking low quality because they aren't raw bit images. They are compressed, so instantly loose their quality. MW2 is a much neater and more polished looking MW1, the weather is superior too.<br>
  <br>
  I've already suggested a highly logical reason why it's not an update, for those who say most games issue updates - care to explain <strong>WoW: Burning Crusade</strong>? (to name but one)<br>
  <br>
  The remainderrr ends up as: <strong>You still don't need to buy Mall Points</strong>. There will be people who will buy them for you. There are other methods of obtaining Mall Items, including, &quot;Newbie Silver&quot;, plus one or two others which will make it accessible for everyone.

  I care to explain not only that but the return of the lich king. Maybe we use the term &quot;update&quot; in a more broader way here.<br>
  <br>
  If you go and read the wow site, Sparkie, you will notice that those two titles are called expansions. They add more content and new gameplay.<br>
  <br>
  The really awesome part is that all that is done without any negative effect on the player. They will not loose level, skill, items or what not.<br>
  <br>
  I want to see the same thing applied to MW.<br>
  <br>
  And before you send me play WoW I'd like to say that I don't want to play it - I love playing MW, but I think that game can set some examples in terms how things are done to benefit the company and the players. A win-win situation. This is what I want to see from IGG. Not on the same scale of course but you can follow the best practise principles no matter the scale.

  I agree with Stryka, except I slightly differ with the Item mall indicator. In todays commercial world it makes sense to export a commodity and not alienate it. Ok so MW2 might already have 1m+ ids registered. But I would assume that IGG would want to make this an exportable commodity. In other words. For players all over the world to be attracted to it.<br>
  Is it not fair to assume then, that if with the launch of MW2 there is no transfers or compensation of any kind to the MW1 players then that new product (mw2) will be tarnished by the bad name of the old one(mw1)<br>
  Also, consumers vote with thier feet so to say. Agressive marketing by making an old product obsolete or by withdrawing support for it in an attempt to dirve up sales for the new product has been proved in the past to be a folly.<br>
  If there is a staement saying that IGG will continue to support and develop MW1 then maybe I would take a look at MW2. Or if there is a transfer option or a compensation start package for MW2 then again I might take a look. But if MW1 is left to rot at the expense of MW2 then I for one will take my wallet elsewhere.<br>
  Loyalty surely must work both ways here. For players to remain loyal to a specific game or provider they need to have faith in it.<br>
  One thing is for sure. By all the opinions and concerns that are being voiced on here and in the game chat, and also on numerous game forums around the world, players are worried that they are being givrn a raw deal. Is it not time then for IGG to come forward and reassure these players as to what thier future stategy plans are for both games and how 1 will affect the other?<br>

  I have no problem with starting completely over under 1 condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a variety of starter packs based on level and skill of current characters.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  For example, packs for:<br>
  -anyone with skills III and IV<br>
  -level 100+<br>
  -reborn with skills III and IV<br>
  -reborn level 100+<br>
  -have a bonus for perfect reborns and for anyone dark blue.<br>
  ---characters until level 50 get nothing.<br>
  <br>
  Each pack would either be a number of mall points, or something they get in game from an NPC.&nbsp;&nbsp;We would not lose our old characters, but we would not be able to claim them again to get the starter pack.&nbsp;&nbsp;That way, we still all start at the same place, but get something for our previous work.

  </div>So i loose everything i spent (as everyone that buys mall) and to get a few things back i have to pay? LOL<br>
  <br>
  Actualy is not beying reborn or db and start from level 1 that is a problem for me. The problem is loosing all the things i got, that i payed for, that cost money. The aods, all the pets... everything.<br>
  <br>
  If IGG does not transfer or continue with MW1( i would prefer mw1 with updates and decent events) i would also be one of the quitters.<br>
  <br>
  And from what i've seen most of the ones that give the money will do the same. But its up to IGG.

  same old things i hear every time an announcement about mw2 is posted. still amusing how people assume so much and assume they know more about making profit than the company that's running so many of the games.

  I for one will not play MW2 if they do not transfer for ordinary materials in the game for my characters... I don't want to lose my progress and pets I spent money on without getting the recompense in mall points to reobtain what I would lose.&nbsp;&nbsp;IGG has done a wonderful job on their other games and MW was good cept it's getting boring... MW2 should just be a major overhaul like what they did with Guildwars and KOL... If not well again as I said I will not play

  </div>after somewhere between 6k and 8k fights you have to feed your pet an item that comes from the mall otherwise it dies or runs <img src="images/smilies/new/f77.gif" smilieid="73" border="0" alt=""><br>
  <br>
  have to catch pets, which means crap growth rates, and even worse statting of points.....means lots of SoM's, SoD's, Eyes, Bones, SoC's.<br>
  <br>
  Believe Simslim0 and Crony both said that its either +2 crystals and up or +3 crystals and up are available on the mall.<br>
  <br>
  Just remember, IGG needs to profit from anything that says Mythwar Online, because evidentally all the other games are relative garbage, that the money from this game went to the others <img src="images/smilies/new/f19.gif" smilieid="87" border="0" alt="">

  i dont think igg will forget about mw1 however mw2 is another game.like for example lineage and lineage2 are both game of the same producer and old player from lineage 1 went to lineage2 and still got their acct on the first 1<br>
  igg will keep both game so dont worry about it

  you are forgetting that both lineage games are f2p and NC soft is a much better company<br>

  also those 2 are very different in terms of everything<br>

  When IGG announced the merge of servers many ppl compained, some1 protested but in the end we saw it was a<br>
  necesary step forward and also after sometime we saw that the change was also good.<br>
  True mw2 borrows some features from mw1 but in all is all toghether a diff game.....Sistem of skills aren't the same, maps r cut in many small ones, organized NPCs, new quests, new skills, new forging utilities and so on...to many to make the features from mw1 integrated into mw2.<br>
  Maybe we need a new step forward, maybe we need a boost....but if is a blank start then make it a blank start for all <img src="images/smilies/new/f45.gif" smilieid="79" border="0" alt=""><br>
  Also if new games comes plz make sure the forum of mw2 have some mods, lacks of mods activities have shown in mw1 forum.<img src="images/smilies/new/f77.gif" smilieid="73" border="0" alt="">

  like everyone is thinking what about all those high paying players and working hard&nbsp;&nbsp;to get deity/saint pets? if i remember on your site it says FREE TO PLAY. FREE FOREVER. [something like that] now that there will be a mythwar 2 how many players do you think will come pay to start over again? like Alpha_Omega said why throw away &quot;guaranteed&quot; money for hoping others will pay more? Also i been hearing that the wild pets you catch you keep and have to feed it. wtf we playing neopets? Also im curious if you will have a 2nd reborn then why do we start over insted of character transfer? Do you expect players to start from 0. Get to 104. reborn. then get to 1-124. And reborn again? <img src="images/smilies/new/f83.gif" smilieid="107" border="0" alt=""> . I really think gms need to think over what they are trying to do. i really wanna knock some sense into you guys. <img src="images/smilies/new/f65.gif" smilieid="106" border="0" alt=""> ......

  You all missing a point. There is no trick or betray with MWO2 is coming out, cause that's a brand new game, with similar name and similar features only by &quot;coincidence&quot;. IGG betrayed players when they announced many new features long-long ago which never got into game. Just for the most important, second reborn should be out by long. But there were many other features too. People could be pissed also, cause when MWO2 was first announced there was clear statement, or promise about some transfering and compensation. Not to mention that announcement when MWO2 comes out MWO gets some new improvements taken from the new game. With different developers this is nearly impossible. Yeah MWO is free but people was spending money on mall, supporting the game with the belief that it will get somewhere. And now it comes out the all were a lie? At minimum the fair way would be to tell players that MWO is not going to get support from developers anymore, so all know what to expect. (Still would be happy to hear an official denial on that.)<br>
  <br>
  And because MWO2 is really a new game, it could truly happen that many players will choose from the wild variety of other games to start over not MWO2. Could be mall spenders. And if they only concentrate on spenders that would be also a bad marketing strategy. I do believe there are many player who'd be willing to spend more if they would feel a strong basis and support from IGG. I'm one of those. But if it goes this way I won't bugger with any of the game version anymore.

  The only thing which really makes me think about<br>
  is the pet feeding system. The old pet system was good<br>
  and if you have to feed your pet and also have to buy food from<br>
  the mall this game won´t be for me.<br>

  As far as i know, VIP's will get a compensation that is probably a deity pet or aod lv2 or so! while rest of players have to make everything back again... And mw1 for sure won't still be the same after mwII show up! since all VIP's gona transfer&nbsp;&nbsp;that mean no more mall items are geting in mwI&nbsp;&nbsp;= thigns gona be very very very expensive! = most gona leave game&nbsp;&nbsp;plus the massive decrease of population at mwI&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;so eventually technicians will delete mwI and use the servers on mwII<br>
  It's logical<br>
